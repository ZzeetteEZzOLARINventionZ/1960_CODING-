Spherical Geometry & 19.5 Degrees 
throughout the solar system



spherical geometry
 NEXT: The Piri Reis map  



19.5 degrees north and south are the latitudes
 where the apex points of a star tetrahedra within a sphere 
will contact that sphere's surface,
 when one apex is positioned at the north or south pole. 

On the Sun: sunspot activity and the region of peak temperatures is limited to 19.5 degreees north and south. 
 On Venus: the presumably active major volcano complexes Alpha and Beta Regio are near 19.5 degrees.


On Earth: 
 Mauna Loa, Hawaii (19 degrees 28 minutes N, 155 degrees 37 minutes W) The largest shield volcano is at 19.6 degrees north. This is Mauna-Kea volcano on the island of Hawaii. 
 Mexico City, Mexico (19 degrees 23 minutes N, 99 degrees 10 minutes W) The Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan is at 19.6 degrees north. 
 Dzibalchen, (Yucatan), Mexico (19 degrees 28 minutes N, 89 degrees 46 minutes W) 
 Georgetown, Grand Cayman Island (19 degrees 18 minutes N, 81 degrees 26 minutes W) 
Mount Emi Koussi, Chad, Africa (19 degrees 47 minutes N, 18 degrees 34 minutes E) 
 Mount Kalsubai, (near Bombay), India (19 degrees 33 minutes N, 73 degrees 43 minutes E) 
 Mountain near Xiangkhoang, Laos (19 degrees 17 minutes N, 103 degrees 17 minutes E) 
 Mountain near Potosi, Bolivia (19 degrees 13 minutes S, 66 degrees 22 minutes W) 
 Yasur Volcano, Tanna Island, Vanuatu (South Pacific Ocean) (19 degrees 31 minutes S, 169 degrees 25 minutes E) 
 Mount Samuel, Northwest Territory, Australia (19 degrees 13 minutes S, 134 degrees 8 minutes E) 
 Gweru, Zimbabwe, Africa (19 degrees 31 minutes S, 29 degrees 49 minutes E) 

On Mars: the "vast" Olympus Mons shield cone volcano is at 19.5 degrees. 
 On Jupiter: the "red spot" which is an obvious vortex is at 19.5 degrees. 
 On Neptune: in 1986 Voyager II discovered a similar spot at 19.5 degrees north. 

 Sedona: Beyond the Vortex 
Why '19.5 degrees' is Significant 

19.5 degrees is the angle that's been found by Adrian.Orozco.Jimenez.Acosta.Gamez
Nile Time-Map & tetrahedral geometry -- 19.5 degrees 
 http://prophetic.simplenet.com/elysium/nile-timemap.htm 

The emphasis on 19.5 degrees is not confined to the Martian structures. It has been found to be associated with various ancient structures here on earth - Giza pyramids, Avebury (the largest stone circle in the world, near Stonehenge), Pyramids of the Sun and Moon at Teotihuacan, etc. It is also worth noting that the Egyptian hieroglyph for Sirius, the brightest star in the sky which was extremely important to ancient Egyptians, is an equilateral triangle which can be viewed as a 2-dimensional representation of a tetrahedron; and in the Egyptian translation, it means a doorway... a sort of 'stargate'. Curiously, it has also been observed that 19.5 degrees is closely linked, for some reason, with the NASA space missions (for example, Mars Pathfinder landed at 19.5 degrees lat. of Mars on July 4, '97). In fact, not only did Pathfinder landed at 19.5 N, the longitude of the landing site was approximately 33 W - which is the very number of the longitude of the apex of the Great Bend of the Nile (33 E)! Now, this strongly insists on the relevance of the Nile numbers, and someone behind the scenes is well aware of it. As we move on, the number, 19.5, will also be very important in my Nile Time-map theory. Perhaps, as the Nile-Mars connection bridged by '19.5' appears to suggest, Mars was somehow involved during the 'Prometheus / Pandora period'.

12 Devil's Triangles



12 evenly spaced areas of anomaly 
 NEXT: Anti-Gravity and the World Grid book and maps.

 "... i set out to 'pattern the mysteries' by taking full advantage of modern communication technology and statistical data analysis. His success was startling. "The Twelve Devil’s Graveyards Around the World," plotted ship and plane disappearances worldwide, focusing attention on 12 areas, equally spaced over the globe, in which magnetic anomalies and other energy aberrations were linked to a full spectrum of strange physical phenomena.
 Highest on Sanderson’s statistical priority list was a lozenge-shaped area east of Miami, in the Bahamas, on the western tip of the infamous Bermuda Triangle. This area’s "high profile" of strange events, Sanderson concluded, was mostly due to the enormous flow of air/ sea traffic in the area. Other zones of anomaly, though less familiar, were equally rich in disappearances and space-time shift occurrences. ...
 Another area of continuing disappearances and mysterious time-warps is the Devil’s Sea located east of Japan between Iwo Jima and Marcus Island. Here events have become so sinister that the Japanese government has officially designated the area a danger zone. Sanderson theorized that the tremendous hot and cold currents crossing his most active zones might create the electromagnetic gymnastics affecting instruments and vehicles. His theory is now being balanced against several." - - Anti-Gravity and the World Grid  page 35.
