Retroactive Advancements and the Avenue to Obtaining Relief

Published Date: Mon, 31 Aug 2015 13:30:01 CDT


By: YN1 Arnold Uhrina, CG-PSC-epm-1 

Background: The Career Retentions section of CG PSC-epm-1 holds the responsibility of reviewing requests for retroactive advancement, which is addressed in policy under Article 3.A.22.c of the Enlisted Accessions, Evaluations, and Advancements Manual, COMDTINST M1000.2 (series). What this means is the member's command must work with the Servicing Personnel Office (SPO) to take action to advance the member within 30 days after the day the CO signed the Career Development Worksheet (CDW). As for the "No Exceptions" rule, advancements may not take place any earlier than the date of the Commanding Officer's Signature. 

Example: FA Arnold Uhrina is eligible and recommended by the Commanding Officer for advancement on 11 January 2015; the CO signs the CDW on the same day. The SPO, however, does not receive the CDW until 16 April 2015. The SPO should advance him to E3/FN effective 16 April 2015 or as early as 17 March 2015, 30 days prior to the date the CDW was received and could be entered into Direct Access. Advancement on a date from 11 January 2015 to 16 March 2015 would be considered "retroactive". In another scenario, if the CO discovered on 16 April 2015 that FA Uhrina was not advanced due to a CDW not being completed, the EARLIEST that FA Uhrina could be advanced would be the date the CO signs the CDW; no exceptions.* 

*In this scenario, if the reason the CO signed the CDW late was due to a processing delay at the unit (or for other applicable reasons), the CO may submit a request via memo to CG PSC-epm-1 requesting a correction to the date of advancement and state the reason for the correction to the date.

Application: Article 3.A.20 of Enlisted Accessions, Evaluations, and Advancements Manual, COMDTINST M1000.2 (series) defines who has the authority to advance enlisted members. Retroactive advancement requests typically pertain to either 1) those advancing from E1/E2 to the next higher paygrade; or 2) those who are assigned a designator from "A" school that have not yet met the requirements for advancement. Please contact PSC-epm-1, via e-mail to ARL-PF-CGPSC-EPM-1-Career-Retentions@uscg.mil for further guidance regarding other scenarios. The member must meet all applicable advancement requirements found in Article 3.A.4.b of the Enlisted Accessions, Evaluations, and Advancements Manual, COMDTINST M1000.2 (series) to be eligible for advancement. 

Process: Determine if the advancement is considered retroactive. If the request is retroactive, the SPO should advance the member to the appropriate paygrade per the SPO Advancements User Guide authorized on the CDW using the most recent 1st or 16th of the month that has passed. Do not submit retroactive advancement requests without advancing the member to the appropriate paygrade. 
1.The Command or SPO, whichever caused the delay, may submit a request using the standard memo format addressed "To: CG PSC-epm-1" requesting retroactive advancement. Include a copy of the CDW and advancement certificate (if available). In the case of the request to change the date of advancement, the request should come from the member's Command. The memo should address that steps have been taken locally to prevent future occurrences. 
2.Forward all requests for retroactive advancement to our e-mail address: ARL-PF-CGPSC-EPM-1-Career-Retentions@uscg.mil. We will review the dates between when the member was originally eligible and recommend for advancement up to the day before the current advancement date. If we approve the retroactive advancement, PPC (adv) will be notified to take appropriate action. 
3.In the case of the member's Enlisted Employee Review (EER), we often see that the member was scheduled to advance to E3 in January, the same month that E2 evaluations are due in Direct Access. Appropriately, the command would process the E3 marks in February, however sometimes this is delayed due to a retroactive advancement error that is currently being processed by our department. Once a determination is made by CG PSC-epm-1 regarding the retroactive advancement request, the unit should retroactively enter in the appropriate EER for the member's pay grade. 

Contact us at ARL-PF-CGPSC-EPM-1-Career-Retentions@uscg.mil with any questions or concerns regarding the above information.

Military Separation Pay Policy

 TO ALCOAST
 UNCLAS //N07220//

SUBJ: CONSOLIDATION OF MILITARY SEPARATION PAY POLICY 

A. Eligibility of Regular and Reserve Enlisted Personnel for Separation Pay, COMDTINST 1910.1
 B. Coast Guard Pay Manual, COMDTINST M7220.29 (series) 

1. This ALCOAST announces the cancellation of Eligibility of Regular and Reserve Personnel for Separation Pay, COMDTINST 1910.1, REF A. Separation pay remains authorized, as the majority of the policy for the payment of separation pay in REF A has already been incorporated into the Coast Guard Pay Manual, COMDTINST M7220.29 (series), REF B. Paragraphs two through four below, extracted from REF A, remain in effect and will beincluded in the next revision to the Coast Guard Pay Manual. 

2. Separation payment shall be computed to one half of the amount computed in Section 10-H-4.a.(1) of REF B for the following conditions: 
a.Substandard performance, 
b.Convenience of the Government, 
c.Drug abuse rehabilitation failure, 
d.Alcohol abuse rehabilitation failure, or 
e.Loss of Security clearance. 
f.The member is being separated under a Coast Guard specific program established as half payment by the Commandant. 

3. A member who declines training that the Coast Guard offers to change their rating as a precondition to reenlistment or continuation on active duty will not be eligible for separation pay. 

4. A member may be allowed to separate up to 60 days before the required separation date and remain eligible for separation pay if all other requirements are met. 

5. This change will be included in the next update to REF B. 

6. Questions regarding this cancellation should be directed to LCDR Russ Mayer, COMDT (CG-1331) at HQS-PolicyandStandards@uscg.mil 

7. Released by RADM Kurt B. Hinrichs, Acting Director of Reserve and Military Personnel. 

8. Internet release authorized.

Known Issue: Family Separation Allowance (FSA)

Published Date: Mon, 31 Aug 2015 13:30:01 CDT


In accordance with CG Pay Manual, member's are eligible for FSA when they have been away from homeport for more than 30 days. So on the 31st day away from homeport, the member would be eligible. The day of return counts towards eligibility, but not for pay. There is a glitch in DA 9.1 when calculating exactly 30 days of eligibility. 

Example: 

Member goes TDY 6/17 thru 7/17. Eligibility is day for day. Member was TDY 31 days, but the day of return does not count for pay. DA 9.1 entry needs to be 6/17 thru 7/16. When this is entered, DA 9.1 will error out stating member was not TDY for more than 30 days. 
Example data entry:
data entry dates 

Resulting error message:
error message 



If you encounter this error, submit the transaction as required, capture the screen shot of the error. Submit a trouble ticket with the screen shot (in a word doc), the FSA Worksheet, and the TDY orders. PPC will manually fix it.

Manual Stop of SGLI Required Upon Release from Active Duty (RELAD)

Published Date: Mon, 31 Aug 2015 11:00:01 CDT


The SPO must stop SGLI for members who are released from active duty and transferred to the IRR and who have no intention to drill (for points only or for further assignment to the SELRES). Global Pay will continue deductions for SGLI for IRR members unless the coverage is stopped upon RELAD. To stop the SGLI deduction, select the Coverage Election of "Waive" as prescribed in step 8 of the procedures section in the SPO SGLI user guide

Known Issue: Miscalculation of Expiration of Enlistment for Extension

Published Date: Mon, 31 Aug 2015 11:00:01 CDT


A system change request has been submitted to correct the logic used to determine the new expiration of enlistment date for extensions and reextensions. Currently the system is miscalculating the date. It is one day short. 

Example: 

Member extended for 6 months to comply with PCS orders. Member's EOE was 3/31/18. A 6 month extension should have resulted in a new EOE of 9/30/18, however DA is calculating 9/29/18. 

Currently the only way to correct this erroneous contract data is to notify PPC Customer Care via a trouble ticket.

DD-214 and Separation Orders Data Values

How Scammers Target Military Personnel

Published Date: Fri, 28 Aug 2015 10:30:01 CDT


Are they your battle buddy - or just unbelievable?

August 27, 2015
 by Carol Kando-Pineda
 Attorney, FTC's Division of Consumer & Business Education 

If you serve - or have served - in the military, chances are you feel a pretty tight bond with your brothers-and sisters-in-arms. If you share a common experience with someone, it only makes sense that you trust them, want to associate with them, or even do business with them. 

But here's something to bear in mind: scammers count on your trust in fellow servicemembers - and use it against you. A con artist might have actual service experience or they might be lying about it. Either way, they're highly skilled at exploiting a military connection to get in good with you. Once they have your trust, they use it to deflect any questions and to throw you off track while they cheat you. It's known as affinity fraud - when someone uses their membership in a group to scam another member. It could be someone claiming you can trust them because of the shared experience of serving in the military. 

Scammers try to use a supposed military bond to take your hard-earned cash. They may pursue servicemembers, families, or anyone with sympathy for the military community. The scams can take many forms, from promises for quick and easy credit and car title loans to sky-high returns on bogus investment deals. Or they might lure you with hopes for online romance, interest in charitable giving, or the appeal of getting super sweet housing at eye-catching prices. Here are a few tips to help you see clearly if a scammer tries blowing smoke at you. 
•Walk, don't run. Take your time. Any deal that pressures you to act immediately probably doesn't end well for you. Slow down and think about it - rushing into a supposed "deal" will usually just buy you trouble. 
•Hold the line on the hype. Is this deal promising you the moon and the stars? Are they claiming you'll see risk-free results on an investment? Stop - there's no such thing as "risk-free." Don't let a scammer's skillful hype cloud your thinking. 
•Listen for the name game. Do they throw around the words "veterans" or "military families" in their name or ads? That doesn't necessarily mean that veterans or the families of active-duty personnel support the organization or will benefit from a donation. 
•Get it in writing. Before you open your wallet, look at the terms of the deal in writing. Then take your time and review. Are the terms what you expected? If not, can you really trust that company? 
•Check it out. Always do your homework. Talk to others. Look up the company online and search for consumer complaints. Consider whether this deal works for you. Can you afford to lose your money?

Known Issue/Work Around - Housing Allowance or COLA Change on the Last Day of Month

Published Date: Wed, 19 Aug 2015 12:30:01 CDT


BAH, OCOLA, FSH, or OHA with Effective Date on Last Day of Month (19 August 2015): If there is a change that affects BAH, OCOLA, FSH, or OHA and the effective date is the LAST day of the month, DA 9.1 is not prorating the amount correctly. When an entitlement is started or stopped on the last day of the month the system will either debit or credit the previous 15 days. 

Example, a married member getting BAH w/DEPN (spouse is only DEPN). Member gets divorced on 5/30. SPO enters a new BAH Row for 5/31 at w/o depns rate. DA will erroneously pay BAH w/o DEPN from 5/16 - 5/31. This only happens on transactions with effective day being the last day of the month. 

Until DA programming is corrected, the SPO's are directed to start or stop the entitlement on the 1st day of the following month and make a note on the note pad that the entitlement's true start date is the last day of the previous month. Then submit a PPC Customer Care Ticket informing us of this action and PPC will manually credit/debit the member for the last day of the month accordingly.

Timely Processing of Reserve Transactions

Published Date: Wed, 19 Aug 2015 10:30:01 CDT


It has come to our attention that some Reserve Active Duty for Training (ADT) orders were not placed in a "Finished" status before pay-cut, this has led to over $300K in overpayments to reservists. Your assistance in the timely processing of all Reserve orders is critical to the orderly execution of funds at the end of the Fiscal Year. SPOs are reminded to not rely on the "Orders Integration Process" to stop the orders. If the process fails, Direct Access will continue to pay out unless the orders are manually stopped. SPO supervisors must continuously evaluate all open orders to prevent these overpayments. 

Similarly, supervisors of reservists must transition all approved Inactive Duty Training (IDT) drills to a "completed" status, and SPOs must perform associated pay transactions, as soon as possible following the completion of the member's drill. This will reduce the number of pending drills that must be accounted for financial prior to the end of the FY and free up funds for other training priorities. 

Please be sure to execute reserve PCS orders when reserve members check-in. We have been notified by PSC-RPM that several sets of orders have not been executed in DA. 

The attention and assistance of the SPO community is greatly appreciated!

Direct Access Data Transfer to DMDC/DEERS Delayed

Published Date: Wed, 12 Aug 2015 12:30:01 CDT


The Coast Guard is experiencing difficulties updating the Defense Eligibility Enrollment Reporting System (DEERS). This is causing problems for members trying to obtain identification cards following an accession or reenlistment/extension of enlistment. 

This is the workaround for ID cards while DEERS data is not being updated by Direct Access. 

If the member is already in DEERS, but needs data updated (i.e. due to reenlistment), the member needs to take a copy of the supporting document to the local DEERS site and they should be able to update it to issue an ID card. If the DEERS site cannot update the record or a new record needs to be entered in DEERS (i.e. an accession), the Site Security Manager (SSM) or Verifying Official (VO) at the DEERS site must contact Jacqueline Smith at the Coast Guard DEERS Project Office (via e-mail to ARL-PF-CGPSC-PSDFS-DEERS@uscg.mil or by telephone at 703-872-6642). All data MUST be in DA before any DEERS updates are made.

One Millionth CGFIXIT Ticket Worked

Published Date: Wed, 12 Aug 2015 12:30:01 CDT


On 23 June, The Centralized Service Desk (CSD) received and worked the C4ITSC's one millionth CGFIXIT incident. The Service Center considers a CGFIXIT ticket an "incident" when it is submitted due to something being broken or a capability lost. During the days leading up to the 23rd, they had been closely monitoring CGFIXIT for this special ticket and once it was worked, the entire floor took a moment to acknowledge a milestone reached. 

The analyst who worked the incident was Mr. Geoffrey Van Matre, a seasoned and valued technician who has been with the CSD since the beginning. When asked about his time at the CSD, Mr. Van Matre said,"It is impressive how fast the CSD has grown since I arrived in 2011. CSD has become a critical component and front door to centralized C4IT support services across the enterprise, and it has been a pleasure being a part of that maturity. We work tens-of-thousands of tickets each month and it requires a lot of patience, adaptability, and resilience, but when we hear about how we somehow contributed to achieving Coast Guard missions, then it's all worth it." 

Within its first two years as an official USCG organization, the C4ITSC successfully transitioned over 25 local service desks and new services into what we now call the CSD. The integrated array of services included Nationwide Automatic Identification System, National Distress System, Command, Control, and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN) service desk, CG Academy and SIPRNet support. Each new service at the CSD results in more tickets (incidents and work orders) making the current on average received ticket volume approximately 21,800 per month. Approximately 12,000 of those tickets are resolved at the CSD while the others are routed to additional C4IT support entities. The increasing volume of incidents handled by the CSD is a testament to its value within the overall C4IT support community.

Incorrect Classification and Category on RELAD Transactions

Published Date: Tue, 11 Aug 2015 10:30:01 CDT


Currently, there are well over 100 members with incorrect RELAD information with more coming in each day. Members are being RELAD into the IRR, but their EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATION is being marked as AD or SELRES. In addition, no PAYCAT information is being entered. Ensure that EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATION reflects where the member is going, not where they are departing from. The EMPLOYEE CATEGORY should match EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATION and the TRAYPAY CAT is important to keep member's information as up to date as possible. 

If the information is entered incorrectly, the SPO that submitted the transaction will need to correct it. If the correction is done AFTER the separation orders are in a "Finished" status (the "Orders Status"), a trouble ticket will also need to be submitted by the SPO Auditor detailing the corrections that need to be completed by PPC.

FY15 Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) Procedure Update

Published Date: Wed, 05 Aug 2015 10:30:01 CDT


In response to questions about the SRB's authorized by ALCOAST 193/15 and PPC's e-mail ALSPO dated 12JUN2015 (See "Fiscal Year 2015 Bonus Procedures"), PPC provides the following information and updates. 
1.Processing Times: The PPC Bonus Team is experiencing a heavy volume of SRB requests, creating backlog. As such, our processing times have suffered. PPC's goal is to have all SRB requests processed within two pay periods from date of submission to PPC. Due to the heavy volume, our processing times have slowed to an average of two to three pay periods. We expect the processing time to improve as we clear the backlog. 
Once PPC receives a PPC Trouble Ticket requesting payment of the bonus, that request will be worked in the order it was received. Once the Trouble Ticket is ready for processing, the "POC" for the Trouble Ticket will receive an e-mail from the bonus team letting them know when the member should expect payment of their bonus. 

2.General guidance: For SRB's, if a member already has an approved (SRB) reenlistment in DA, please bypass the CG-3307 SRB verification process and submit the payment request directly to PPC in the form of a PPC Trouble Ticket; the request must include the member's CG-3307 and reenlistment contract. 

3.FSO Kicker: Understandably, there has been some confusion as to what the qualifications are for members to receive the FSO kicker. In the past, members needed to have the appropriate competency code in DA for kickers. This is not 100% correct with the FSO kicker offered by ALCOAST 193/15. 
According to section 7(c) of ALCOAST 193/15, in order to be eligible for the FSO kicker, a member needs to be "qualified" to assume the duties and responsibilities of a Food Service Officer IAW chapter 1.C.17 of COMDTINST M1000.8 (Military Assignments and Authorized Absences Manual). They do not have be in an FSO or IDFSO billet, they just have to be eligible (or qualified) to be assigned to one. Essentially, any FS2 or above who meets the below qualifications is eligible for the FSO kicker, even if they do not have the FS17 competency in DA. 

1.C.17.b. Qualifications 


(1) Candidates must not have a total mark average of less than four on their enlisted employee review and no mark of unsatisfactory in conduct during two years prior to submission of request, 
(2) Candidates may have no record of performance probation, civil arrest, courts-martial, non-judicial punishment (NJP), alcoholism, drug misuse, indebtedness, etc., for two years prior to submission of request, and 
(3) Candidates must comply with weight standards contained in reference (l), Coast Guard Weight and Body Fat Standards Manual, COMDTINST M1020.8 (series).


If an FS2 or higher meets the above requirements, regardless of whether or not they possess the FS17 competency code in DA, the mandatory requirement to document FSO kicker eligibility is to have the member complete a separate CG-3307 claiming the FSO kicker. This FSO CG-3307 must be signed by the member's Commanding Officer; "by direction" signature authority is prohibited. Likewise, the FSO CG-3307 should be submitted along with a member's SRB-05 to the PPC-SMB-MAS-Bonus email account when obtaining SRB eligibility verification. 

The FSO CG-3307 (SRB-05a Counseled on FSO Kicker FY15 SRB) has been drafted and is provided in enclosure (6) of the Personnel and Pay Procedures Manual; it may be accessed by visiting: www.uscg.mil/ppc/3307s.asp. 

If FSO kicker eligibility was not determined upon a member's (Zone A) SRB payment, then please submit an FSO kicker CG-3307 to PPC via a PPC Trouble Ticket requesting payment. IAW with paragraph 3 of ALCOAST 193/15, eligible members must apply through their local servicing personnel office no later than 01SEP2015. Late applications will not be accepted.

Communicating with PPC via Administrative Official Information Exchange (Admin OIX)

Published Date: Thu, 30 Jul 2015 10:30:01 CDT


Beginning August 3, 2015, the Coast Guard is shifting from its traditional communication method of sending all official information via the Coast Guard Messaging System (CGMS) to using today's technology for exchanging official non-operational information. 

Admin OIX is a new, standardized method for sending and receiving administrative information. Administrative information is defined as messages related to the organization of service forces, personnel management, unit logistics, individual and unit training, discipline, program changes, and other matters that are not operational. 

PPC's Admin OIX mailbox address is "CMD-SMB-CG-PPC". Only use this mailbox when, in the past, you would have sent a message via CGMS (e.g. Placement on a striker or supplemental advancement list, withholding an advancement, etc.). Do not use the Admin OIX mailbox unless use of record message traffic is directed. 

All PPC customer service requests, which include SWE PDE correction and/or waiver requests and EER change requests, must be submitted through the PPC Customer Care Branch. To submit your request please call 866-PPC-USCG (866-772-8724), or send your email to "PPC-DG-CustomerCare", or go to our Customer Care Branch web page at http://www.uscg.mil/ppc/ccb/ and select the "Trouble Ticket" tab and submit your request online. 

More information on Admin OIX, including a full list of Admin OIX shared mailboxes, is available on the CGPortal OIX website. 

The process for Personnel Casualty Reports will be reworked to take advantage of the features available in Admin OIX. More information is forthcoming. Until directed, send Personnel Casualty Reports in the format shown in the Personnel and Pay Procedures Manual (Enclosure 7) but replace message addresses with the appropriate Admin OIX mailbox addresses.

Submit Requests to PPC for Specialized Virtual Training

Published Date: Tue, 28 Jul 2015 12:30:01 CDT


PPC Procedures and Development branch to Offer Specialized Virtual Sessions

Introduction:

Now that the official launch of DA 9.1 has concluded and PPC Procedures and Development staff is back on the road, it is time to introduce another training option for personnel support staffs. As you are aware, there are resident Base training sessions being conducted through the end of fiscal year 2015. We realize that even though we have targeted a large population that some may not be able to attend. 

Virtual Training Requests:

After everything that has been published and shared there still may be some specific areas that need guidance and attention. In order to continue to meet our customer service obligations, PPC Procedures and Development would like to extend the availability of specialized virtual sessions for anyone and everyone upon request. We are more than willing to customize a session for your office that meets specific training needs. Some examples of a request follows: 
•My SPO has attended all the virtual sessions and some of us even the resident offerings but we are still having trouble with _____________. 
•We are an ADMIN unit and have discovered that many of the topics available are really targeted at the SPO. We need further guidance and instruction on ______________. 
•We handle all Reserve records and deal mainly with the ISC/DXR and SPO but are still seeking answers in processing _____________. 
•We have been dealing with a lot of Self Service issues from the field regarding pay errors. How does our office counsel the members on ___________. 
•There have been so many changes to both procedure and policy, how do we know what process to follow and where do we find _______________. 

How to Request a Specialized Office Session:

If any of the examples apply to your office or there are other areas you want to explore please send an email detailing the request to: 

Karen.S.Emmot@uscg.mil or call 785-339-2225.

All sessions will be customized to meet your needs and will be held via Adobe Connect with live teleconferencing to elaborate on discussion, hear firsthand your obstacles, and share solutions with everyone.

Transfer Season 2015 and CGOne User Accounts

Published Date: Thu, 23 Jul 2015 11:30:01 CDT


The 2015 Transfer Season is in full swing, and similar to years past, an automated method is being used to move CGOne Standard User accounts from one unit to another. This process, which reconfigures user accounts for use at a new location, does not move user data (such as files maintained on local C4IT resources) but does archive them for a specific time. Because of this, transferring personnel are responsible for performing a number of tasks on their own before departing their unit. More information about end user responsibilities to ensure a smooth and successful transfer of IT resources is on the Transfer Tech Tips site. 

The automated portion of a PCS Transfer is triggered by the transferring member submitting a CGFIXIT ticket at least two weeks before departing their unit. Once a ticket is submitted, the User Transfer Service (UTS) system completes the account transfer process. If a ticket is not submitted in CGFIXIT before departing your old unit, you will experience delays at your new unit. 

Effective and successful transfers are an essential part of Coast Guard operations and affect every member at some point in their career. The Transfer Season team is consistently finding ways to simplify and improve the technical portion of this important process. After you arrive at your new unit, you might receive an email with a survey about the technical portion of your transfer experience. You are encouraged to participate and share your candid feedback so that future transfer seasons may be improved.

Advance Pay and PCS Allowance Policy Reminder

Published Date: Thu, 23 Jul 2015 11:30:16 CDT


Per ALCOAST 304/15, Servicing Personnel Offices (SPO) shall only approve requests for advance pay of up to one month if applicants meet the conditions in paragraph 2 of the message. Any request for two or three months advance pay must be approved by the member's commanding officer in consideration of the guidelines in paragraphs 3.A through 3.E of the message. PCS travel and transportation advances are limited to 80% of the estimated travel and transportation costs to include MALT, per diem, DLA, and TLE. Payment must not be made more than 30 days before the member detaches, except under extenuating circumstances (e.g., member moves dependents before detaching).

Personal Data Record (PDR) Entries Pertaining to an Alcohol or Drug Incident

Published Date: Thu, 23 Jul 2015 11:30:01 CDT


Per the new Coast Guard Health Promotion Manual, COMDTINST M6200.1 (series), the only documents authorized in a member's Personal Data Record (PDR), pertaining to an alcohol or drug incident, are the appropriate Performance and Discipline (P&D) Administrative Remarks, CG-3307 entries, located in Enclosure (6) of The Personnel and Pay Procedures Manual, PPCINST M1000. 2 (series). The Command Drug and Alcohol Representative (CDAR), in coordination with the Substance Abuse Prevention Specialist (SAP) and the command, will ensure that all entries made in the member's PDR completely and accurately document the circumstances of each incident and confirm that the member has been referred for medical evaluation. Documentation for a command or self referral will not be placed in the member's PDR. 

Here are the authorized CG-3307 templates to use for drug and alcohol incidents:


Entry Title

PD-13 Alcohol Incident 
PD-13 Drug Incident 
PD-14 Subsequent Alcohol Incident 
PD-15 Completed Screening 
PD-16 Completed Education 
PD-17 Treatment Failure 
PD-18 Refusal of Treatment 

Note: There is no need or authority to remove obsolete (P&D-19 and P&D-20) or updated entries (listed above) from the PDR.

Training for Passport Acceptance Agents Offered

Published Date: Thu, 23 Jul 2015 11:30:01 CDT


Official Passport Acceptance Agent (OPPA) Certification Course

Commandant (CG-DCO-I-1), Department of State (DoS) and the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) will be hosting a three day Official Passport Acceptance Agent (OPPA) Certification Course September 23 - 25 2015. 

Annually the Coast Guard processes 3,500+ passports for official travel, with the majority of these passports originating from field units. Passport Agents work with local CG members to ensure that passport applications meet CG, DoS and FCG requirements before packages are submitted to CG-DCO-I-1 for processing. Without this face to face assistance to immediately correct errors, there could be significant delay in passport processing, as DoS is forced to return incorrect applications. 

The OPPA training, which is conducted by DoS, FCG and CG-DCO-I-1 at USCGHQ, allows the CG to maintain a trained cadre of Passport Agents to supplant those lost through transfers and RELAD. 

DCO-I considers this training vital to facilitating CG operations overseas including crewmember swaps, as well as LEDET, maintenance assist teams, and other operational and support teams. 

Location of training: USCG Headquarters, Washington, DC. 

Training times: 0800 - 1630 

Target Audience: OPPA Training is targeting Yeoman but is open to all E-4 and above of any Rate including Officers that are US citizens or Naturalized. 

Funding: Certification/Training is funded by member's unit. 

To request a seat in the upcoming training class, please follow the below: 
1.Open the link: http://hqs-spweb10-001:10115/I1/Lists/Agent%20Training%20Request/Default%20View.aspx 
2.Click on NEW at the top. 
3.Click on attach file at the top to upload your scanned documents as one attachment. (Copy of Birth Certificate, Security Clearance data out of DA and approved TDY request or orders) 
4.Fill out every block but the Agent number (this will be filled in after training.) If you are an agent already and this is a refresher course, please enter your agent number and note that you are already an agent in the notes block. 
5.Click on ok to submit form to CG-DCO-I-1. 

Once completed, you will receive an auto generated confirmation email. 

Approximately 2 weeks prior to the class start date, an email with TDY and training information will be sent to all class attendees. 

The deadline to request a seat is September 11, 2015. 

If you have any questions, please send an email to uscgpassports@uscg.mil 

Projected future training dates: 
•January 11-13, 2016 (Alameda, CA) 
•March 15-17, 2016 (USCGHQ) 
•August 23-25, 2016 (USCGHQ)

Approval of Drills, ADT-AT Orders, and Short-Term ADOS Orders During Approval "Blackout"

Published Date: Tue, 21 Jul 2015 14:30:01 CDT


With exceptions for certain reserve pay actions (listed below), no other transactions are to be approved between the SPO Data Entry/Approval Date and the Payroll Finalized Date (blackout period) without authority from PPC (MAS) or (SEP). During this period we run reports and resolve issues on those reports behind the scenes. If a SPO approves a transaction during this period, our reports are no longer valid, and the SPO may undo several hours of work that was done to fix an issue (if the document approved overrides or affects the issue we resolved). 

THE BELOW ONLY APPLIES TO DRILLS, ADT-AT ORDERS AND SHORT-TERM ADOS ORDERS AND PAY ENTITLEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ORDERS or DRILLS. 

Short-Term Orders: If the ADT-AT orders or Short-Term ADOS orders have a begin or end date on/or after the SPO Data Entry/Approval date and BEFORE the Payroll Finalized Date, SPOs are authorized to approve the orders (put in "En route" or "Finished" status) and associated pay entitlements (e.g. BAH). DO NOT approve orders or entitlements on Payroll Finalize Date (it will cause payroll finalize to error out). ONLY orders with a begin data that falls within these specifics date ranges are authorized to be put in an "En route" or "Finished" status. 

Drills: Inactive Duty for Training (IDT) Drills, Funeral Honors Duty (FHD), Readiness Management Periods (RMP), and Additional Training Periods (ATP) and any pay entitlements associated with the drills may be approved between the blackout dates. If the IDT, FHD, RMP, or ATP drills have a completed date on/or after the SPO Data Entry/Approval date and BEFORE the Pay roll Finalized Date, SPOs are authorized to approve the drills (put in "Completed - Yes" status (approved for payment)) and any associated pay entitlements (e.g. meals). Do not approve drills or pay entitlements on the Payroll Finalized Date - it will cause payroll finalize to error out. Only drills and associated pay entitlements with a completion date that falls within these specific date ranges are authorized to be put in a "Completed - Yes" status (approved for payment). 

To reiterate...ONLY DRILLS, ADT-AT ORDERS OR SHORT-TERM ADOS ORDERS AND ASSOCIATED PAY ENTITLEMENTS WITH A BEGIN OR END DATE THAT FALLS WITHIN THESE SPECIFIC DATE RANGES ARE AUTHORIZED TO BE APPROVED DURING THE BLACKOUT PERIOD. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Separations Processing Guidance

Published Date: Wed, 15 Jul 2015 13:30:01 CDT


RELAD Separation Details. When completing the separation order, ensure the Employee Classification, Employee Category and Employee Subcategory (TRAPAY CAT) are consistent. If the categories are not consistent (for example "Selected Reserve" as Employee Classification with an "Employee Subcategory" of H), the orders integration process in DA 9.1 ceases to process. PPC SEP must then locate the individual order, have the SPO correct the order then re-run the orders integration process, delaying all Coast Guard separation order processing. Please see the PPC SEP News July 2015 for guidance on how to manually stop SGLI for members assigned to IRR. 

Changes to Separation Order. Any change to an approved separation order must be re-approved by an Auditor. The order may appear to have updated but any changes will not take effect without being run through the approval process. 

Retired Recall. For retirees with immediate recall, ensure all leave is entered in the "total to Carry Over (Days):" block. Per the Coast Guard Pay Manual, COMDTINST M7220.29 (series), members transferred to the retired list but retained on continuous AD after transfer are not authorized lump sum leave payment.

Erroneous Exceeded 48 drills IDT error

Published Date: Mon, 13 Jul 2015 10:30:01 CDT


Commandant (CG-1312) has received several communications regarding the inability to schedule IDT in DA 9.1 "Exceeded 48 drills IDT error". We are working to determine the cause, scope, and impact of this issue. For now please follow this guidance: 
1.Collect the name, Emplid, number of drills unable to schedule, and months drills unable to scheduled (JUL, AUG, or SEP). 
2.Submit PPC Customer Care trouble tickets through the normal SPO process, including SCR #38536 in the notes will help aggregate quickly at PPC. 
3.Concurrently forward item 1 information to your AREA or DOL. 
4.AREA and DOL, email CG-1312 a running list, send weekly and update as you receive more input. 

AREAs and DOL pass immediately any member who will be impacted during JUL. CG-1312 will address specific cases impacted in July. 

Our #1 goal on this issue is for reservists to execute scheduled IDT drills and receive compensation for work completed. CG-1312 will authorize those impacted by this system error to add authorized drills to DA 9.1 after the 15 July 2015 deadline published in the FY15 RESERVE TRAINING (RT) APPROPRIATION FISCAL YEAR 2015 (FY15) EXECUTION GUIDANCE, paragraph 2.C. (ALCGFINANCE 028/14), once the system error is resolved. 

Multiple people are investigating this issue due to the short fuse impact. We are working toward a technical fix and believe most of the impact will be in AUG and SEP. We have considered multiple work around options, all have negative impacts. If workarounds are required, CG-1312 work individual cases with the appropriate AREA, DOL, and Dxr.

Prepare for Tax Season Now, Register Your Family in DEERS 

Published Date: Tue, 07 Jul 2015 11:30:01 CDT


When you register in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), you provide information necessary for you and your family to receive the full spectrum of your military benefits. Not adding your family to DEERS can affect their access to health care, submitted claim forms and now, your income tax reporting. 

For tax season 2014, you self-reported on your federal tax form whether or not you and your family members had minimum essential coverage (MEC). This tax season, the Department of Defense (DoD) will report health care coverage of its service members and their dependents to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This report allows the IRS to determine which families had minimum essential coverage as required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). 

For tax purposes, individuals and family members are identified by their Social Security Numbers (SSN). All sponsors should confirm that all individual and family members' SSNs are correct in DEERS to ensure information is correctly reported to the IRS. Those who have not met the MEC requirement will be required to pay a fee for the number of months each family member did not have coverage. If your family information is not reported accurately in DEERS, then your IRS information will be reported incorrectly. 

For more information on how TRICARE works with the ACA, go to the TRICARE website.

Military Personnel Data Record (PDR) Maintenance

Published Date: Tue, 29 Jun 2015 12:30:01 CDT


By: Petty Officer Third Class Cody Schott

I'm stationed here at Base Elizabeth City in NC. We've now been a Super SPO for just about a year. The reason I'm writing is to inform Yeoman about something I've been noticing from most incoming PDR's from other units. PDR maintenance is something most YN's neglect to do and something supervisor's don't pay much attention to until an audit comes about. Just about 3/4 of the incoming PDR's I've received this transfer season YN's do not file section 1 chronologically and have found the Qualification to Possess Firearms or Ammunition, DD Form 2760, towards the back just before the copies of the Birth certificates and Social security cards. Section 3 is just as bad with forms being out of place, or needed to be taken out years ago. Section 4 is generally fine with the exception of the amount of orders that are in there, sometimes I'll find 3 or 4 sets of past orders when there only needs to be 2 of the most recent sets.

Don't Forget to Update DEERS

Published Date: Thu, 25 Jun 2015 15:30:01 CDT


The lives of service members and their families are full of transitions. Whether it's permanent change of station moves, retiring, going from Reserve status to active duty or something else, the one constant is change. The good news is that your TRICARE coverage can stick with you through these life changes, but you do have to make sure that your records in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) are up to date with your latest life events.

This means you should keep all your personal information - address, duty status, phone numbers, and email addresses - up to date. It's important to review DEERS as soon as possible whenever you move or experience one of the following life events:
•Activation
•Deactivation
•Separation or retirement
•Becoming Medicare eligible

Changing your contact information in DEERS is easy and can be done online at milConnect (www.dmdc.osd.mil/milconnect), by fax or mail, or in person at the nearest uniformed services identification (ID) card office. One thing you can't update yourself in DEERS is your duty status - only your Service can make those updates. Whenever you have a change in your duty status, check DEERS to make sure it's accurate. You can find your nearest ID card offices online with the RAPIDS Site Locator at www.dmdc.osd.mil/rsl/.

Other life events that can affect your TRICARE eligibility and require you to update DEERS include:
•Marriage or divorce
•Birth or adoption of a child
•Change in a student's full-time enrollment status 

Many DEERS updates require supporting documentation, including: marriage, birth, or death certificates, Medicare cards and Social Security Administration notification letters and orders or DD Forms214/discharge orders. A list of required documentation for various types of updates is available at www.dmdc.osd.mil/rsl/. Make sure to review the list and bring the appropriate documents with you, or you may not be able to make the updates you need.

For more information on how to update DEERS information, go to www.tricare.mil/DEERS.

Providing Your SSN in DEERS

Please note that even though your SSN is being replaced on your ID card, it is still important to provide your SSN and the SSNs of your TRICARE-covered dependents in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). In order to notify the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of your TRICARE coverage, so that the IRS is aware that you have met the minimum essential coverage requirement under the Affordable Care Act, your SSN, and your family members' SSNs must be listed in DEERS.

PPC Direct Access 9.1 Follow-On Training Workshops

Published Date: Thu, 18 Jun 2015 15:30:01 CDT


It's been more than 6 months since the release of Direct Access 9.1. As we all have seen, DA 9.1 is very different than what DA 8.0 was. The HR world had to, and still is, relearning how to do their world of work. PPC Procedures and Development Branch has a small window of time to go out and provide training to Servicing Personnel Offices and Reserve personnel on the DA 9.1 release. The HR Workshop is 5 days and is geared towards SPO personnel, but we highly encourage others that enter data in DA to attend (Personnel and Administration office staffs, YN, DXRs, etc). The Reserve Workshop is 2 days and is intended for the actual Reserve member with encouragement for those who work with Reserve members or handle Reserve records to attend. Due to time and budget, we are only able to visit 5 BASES this summer. While PPC is funding the delivery of the workshops it is the unit responsibility to fund attendance for their members. 

Please contact the Base POC listed below to request attendance for one or both training workshops. 
•Base Miami Beach Jul 13-19 - POC CWO Arnaz Deal / YNC Kalyn Doss 
•Base Alameda Aug 1-7 - POC CWO Ann Cooper

Navy Fleet Post Office (FPO) addresses for ships, mobile units and ashore FPOs are being converted to an address format compatible with the U.S. Postal Service's (USPS) address system. The new address format is effective immediately for mobile units and ashore FPOs. Service members should see their postal representative for their duty station's accurate address.

"The new standardized addresses use a format similar to the way residential mail is addressed across the U.S.," said Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Navy Postal Director Gabe Telles. "Standardization will improve service by reducing transit time, which is good news for Sailors." 

The new format for ships and mobile units is as follows: 

Line 1: Name
 Line 2: Ship or Mobile Unit name
 Line 3: Ship or Mobile Unit number, box number
 Line 4: FPO (AP, AE, AA) ZIP code (5 digits only) 

The new format for ashore FPOs now includes a Postal Service Center (PSC) number and box number along with a 5-digit ZIP code in the address as follows: 

Line 1: Name
 Line 2: PSC number, box number
 Line 3: FPO (AP, AE, AA) ZIP code (5 digits only)

"Sailors will notice immediately that only a 5-digit ZIP code is necessary," Telles said. "This and the new standardized format will be easier for everyone, including businesses, family, and friends sending mail to FPOs." 

Another benefit of the standardization is postal patrons' ability to use the USPS Internet change-of-address process at www.usps.com when rotating to/from new assignments that use FPO addresses. Sailors can find more information at their local FPO or at www.usps.com.

Yeoman in the Spotlight

 series, which runs in South Jersey.

Petty Officer 2nd Class Cynthia Oldham)

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. - Petty Officer 3rd Class Carl Blas, a Coast Guardsman serving at the Coast Guard Air Station in Egg Harbor Twp., New Jersey, was born and raised where America's day begins in Yigo, Guam. 

Deciding to join the Coast Guard and leave Guam was not a difficult decision for Carl. 

"Guam is a beautiful Pacific Island but it is a very small place," Carl said. "I was 23 years old when I joined the Coast Guard and ready to see and experience new places. The Coast Guard gave me this opportunity." 

Serving as a yeoman, the Coast Guard's name for an administrative specialist, Carl is a critical behind-the-scenes component to keeping his Coast Guard shipmates always ready. 

Carl works in the Air Station's servicing personnel office, where yeomen administratively take care of the air station's 254 crew members, focusing heavily on customer service. 

Carl said his passion for customer service began in Guam before he joined the Coast Guard. 

"After I graduated from the University of Guam with a degree in economics I started working at the Bank of Guam, where I gained a lot of my customer service skills," Carl said. "The bank is where I got the urge to combine my love of helping people with my career, which is how I ended up being a Coast Guard yeoman." 

While serving in South Jersey, Carl is expanding his love of service throughout the community. 

"When I first came to the Coast Guard one thing I decided is giving time to the community is so important," Carl said. 

Carl is a full-time student at The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey where he is member of the college's Student Veteran's Organization. Carl serves on the executive board of the SVO as the leader of public relations. 

"Stockton has one of the best student veteran organizations in the country," Carl said. "It's a place where active duty service members can get together and focus on their educations, conquer stress and share their experiences. We have a brotherhood, we all have each others' back." 

Carl said SVO members recently visited with veteran's who live in a local nursing home. 

"While we were at the nursing home, the veterans all wanted to talk about their military experiences," Carl said. "They felt great about passing the baton to the next generation. We are working on making this a monthly event for hospice patients there." 

Carl is also an active member of the school's Pride Alliance Club, a student-run organization focused on brining a sense of unity, power and leadership among Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender students and any student who aspires to be an activist. 

"We all absolutely love Carl," said Kristen Murphy Slagle, co-president of the Pride Alliance Club. "We are so happy to have him with us. He brings us a different perspective, having served and coming from an area other than New Jersey. Stockton itself is predominantly Caucasian, so he naturally adds more culture to a club that is trying to bring up issues of diversity." 

Additionally, Carl is an active member of Fusion Church, in Somers Point, New Jersey, where he volunteers every week to buy and deliver food for the community's youth. 

"Every Sunday night I deliver food to the youth group at Fusion Church," Carl said. "I truly believe the youth here can grow up to be comfortable in who they are. I speak with them, share my story and hope to encourage them to be well-rounded and eager to explore the world." 

Although Carl is Chamorro, a term for someone born and raised in Guam, he feels he vibes well off the people who live in New Jersey. 

Carl said he loves living in south New Jersey because the people are different in the way they are very vocal and stand up for what they think is right. 

Carl said he strongly believes having a voice and using it for good is something he strongly believes in.

Traveling to/from Alaska via Privately Owned Vehicle (POV)

Published Date: Tue, 16 Jun 2015 16:30:01 CDT


You Must Submit a Request via the Aircraft and Personnel Automated Clearance System (APACS) for POV Travel Through Canada

The United States Defense Attache Office Ottawa states that Aircraft and Personnel Automated Clearance System (APACS) is required for personnel that transit (drive) Canada during PCS moves. USDAO is using APACS as a force tracking device and to determine what US military personnel our in country if there is a national emergency. This similar to requirements of other US embassies and Combatant Commands. While NORTHCOM does not require an APACS request, USDAO Ottawa does. 

Transit stops via air and port calls that do not involve an RON would not require an APACS request. 

PCS personnel driving through Canada enroute to or from Canada require an APACS request. 

APACS Procedures

District 17 has the "Guide to Submitting APACS for Canada Travel" available on their CGPortal site. 

Please see Traveling through Canada? for more helpful tips and procedures to help avoid long delays at the borders of Canada/US.

Fiscal Year 2015 Bonus Procedures

Published Date: Tue, 16 Jun 2015 14:30:01 CDT


An "FAQ" to ALCOAST 193/15 has been published to clarify bonus policies. It may be accessed by visiting: www.uscg.mil/hr/cg133/PolicyStandards/FAQs for ALCOAST 193.pdf. 

A new SRB CG-3307 has been provided in enclosure (6) of the Personnel and Pay Procedures Manual. The language of the new CG-3307 has been modified to address the changes ALCOAST 193/15 present in SRB counseling. The updated CG-3307 may be accessed by visiting: www.uscg.mil/ppc/3307s.asp. 

For SRB's, the only contracts allowed to be canceled are: 
a.Extensions (EXT and REN) that have not begun and where an OS member obligated service until 2019 due to AY2015 transfer orders, as detailed in Questions and Answers #11 of the ALCOAST 193/15 FAQ list. 
b. Extensions (EXT and REN) where OS and FS members have obligated service that have not yet begun, BUT STILL MEET the requirements of ALCOAST 193/15 BEFORE the extension is canceled. 

These cancellation requests can only be performed by PPC after the SRB eligible members new 4 or 6 year reenlistment has been approved. Cancellation requests should be submitted at the time a member's SRB payment is being requested. Please be sure to state (in your PPC Trouble Ticket) that an extension needs cancellation by ADV and to request your ticket be reassigned to MAS for processing once ADV cancels contract. 

SRB submission procedures:

BEFORE SRB reenlistment contracts are entered - Submit SRB CG-3307's to PPC-SMB-MAS-Bonus@uscg.mil for verification/approval. Within 3 business days, the sender of the CG-3307 will receive a reply instructing them to either move forward with a member's SRB reenlistment or state the reason(s) member is ineligible. In some cases, it is understood that the SRB CG-3307 eligibility approval process may not be feasible. In such cases, eligibility should be heavily scrutinized. If time allows, it is highly recommended to run SRB 3307's thru the bonus team in order to minimize counseling/eligibility errors. 

Once a contract is completed and approved, SRB payments should be requested by submitting the member's SRB CG-3307 and contract to PPC via a trouble ticket. If a SRB eligible member has an extension that has not begun, then the request should state the ticket should first go to PPC (adv) so that the extension can be canceled, then reassigned to PPC (mas) for SRB processing. 

Payment should occur within the next two pay periods. If a payment has not occurred after two pay periods, then an inquiry should be sent to PPC via a trouble ticket. 

All requests for EBs and CSTBs should be submitted to PPC via a trouble ticket submission and include bonus documentation (Annex or CSTB Agreement). Typically, these requests will come from each members "A" School upon graduation. 

Must be in compliance with weight standards for all bonuses.

Cancellation of SGLI Prior to Separation - Don't do it!

Published Date: Tue, 16 Jun 2015 12:30:01 CDT


According to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs some Personnel Officers are advising Servicemembers to cancel their Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) coverage months or weeks, before their separation date in order to save on premium payments.

This is not good advice. It is imperative that all Personnel Officers and Servicemembers be aware that cancelling SGLI prior to their separation date carries several negative consequences that far outweigh any short-term cost savings.

For example, if a Servicemember cancels SGLI prior to separation from service, then that member:
•Cannot receive 120 days of SGLI coverage at no cost following separation from service (a benefit that all Servicemembers receive when they separate with SGLI coverage intact). 
•Cannot apply for an additional two years of SGLI coverage at no cost through the SGLI Disability Extension Program if they are totally disabled. 
•Cannot obtain Veterans' Group Life Insurance (VGLI) coverage, which is available without proof of good health for 240 days after separation and can be retained for life. 
•Will be cancelling Family SGLI Coverage for his/her spouse and children for the member's remaining time in service and for the 120-day free period after separation. 
•Will be cancelling SGLI Traumatic Injury Protection (TSGLI) and cannot receive a TSGLI payment for qualifying traumatic injuries that occur prior to separation.

Personnel Officers should advise any member who may be considering cancelling their SGLI coverage about the negative consequences listed above.

A couple of her accomplishments while serving at Base Ketchikan include acting as the sole administration yeoman for four weeks during transfer season, demonstrating exception technical expertise while supporting 37 units and supporting 100 personnel and their families. She also proactively contracted approximately 75 members delayed by the Alaska Marine highway ferries to help reschedule travel, minimizing the disruption to incoming and outgoing personnel. 

"Due to her consistent exceptional performance, work ethic and positive attitude, she was nominated for Sailor of the Quarter every quarter of 2014" said Chief Warrant Officer Dominic Heggarty, Base Ketchikan procurement and contracting chief. "Her diligence, perseverance and devotion to duty are most heartily commended and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Coast Guard. "

BAH for 2015 Academy Graduates

Published Date: Thu, 11 Jun 2015 10:30:01 CDT


Graduates of the Coast Guard Academy are entitled to BAH-Transit during periods of travel time, proceed time, and leave enroute to their first permanent duty station. (Graduates with prior service are instead entitled to BAH without dependents while enroute.) 

Upon arrival at the permanent duty station, the newly-commissioned Ensign becomes entitled to the BAH/OHA applicable to the PDS (normally BAH without dependents). 

If the member marries while enroute to the first permanent duty station, the member becomes entitled to BAH with dependents effective the date of marriage (or BAH without dependents if the marriage is to another uniformed services member). BAH with dependents is based on the location of the member's dependents; it then changes to the location of the PDS once the member reports to the PDS. 

For the Academy Class of 2015, PPC (MAS) will pay the BAH-Transit (BAH-T) entitlement. The SPO should only start the BAH at the PDS (as well as any BAH due to marriage) . 

An example is shown below of the BAH row that the SPO should establish effective the date the member reports to the PDS: image of DA screen 

In future years, SPOs will record the BAH-T entitlement on the BAH page. However, this year, we are not having SPOs record the entitlement because of system issues/complexities.

Mailing of SPO Military Personnel Data Records (PDRs)

Published Date: Tue, 09 Jun 2015 13:30:01 CDT


The responsible SPOs for a large number of units have changed with the completion of phase I of the Servicing Personnel Office (SPO) Alignment project. 

Phase I was completed last August. However, almost a year later, dozens of SPO PDRs are being mailed to SPOs that are no longer operational. 

To ensure timely payroll processing and to protect the member's private information, be sure you are mailing the PDR to the correct SPO. 

You'll find tools on the SPO Contact List web page to help you determine the correct SPO for any unit. 

How to Lookup the SPO for a Unit in Direct Access

YN1 Aragoni, Base National Capital Region, discovered a quick and easy way to locate a unit's assigned SPO using the CG Dept Run tab off the Airport Terminal. His procedure guide is linked below. 

How to Lookup a unit's SPOfile in pdf format 

Simply enter the unit's department ID and select the "HRS" relationship type. This will show the unit's assigned SPO. We thought the HRS relationship type wouldn't return any results if the department ID entered wasn't for a SPO. Turns out the CG Dept Run provides a reverse lookup function when used this way. 

Our thanks to YN1 Aragoni for passing this tip along! His method provides real-time results as opposed to the Unit Relationship report we post on the SPO Contact List web page, which is only updated quarterly. 

We are working with Comdt (CG-631) and the project management office in CG-1 to find a way to make SPO mailing addresses available to users within Direct Access. Until a method is provided, you'll have to use the Standard Distribution List, COMDTNOTE 5605, and lookup mailing addresses.

WEBTPAX - Attaching Documents

Published Date: Wed, 03 Jun 2015 12:30:01 CDT


Travelers, authorizing officials, and units have often asked when scanning and attaching documents within WEBTPAX would be authorized. 

As of 1 June 2015 the Pay & Personnel is authorizing and highly encouraging travelers to use the "Manage Image" button within WEBTPAX for members to attach readable scanned .PDF documents/images to be included with ALL Temporary Duty (TDY) advance requests and TDY settlement claims. 

the WEBTPAX manage images button
The "Manage Image" button appears on the Settlement Request and Advance Request screens 

This simple step will streamline processes and save the Coast Guard, travelers, and authorizing officials time and money by reducing postage and copying costs. Additionally, this will reduce the number of debts created for non compliant travel audits. 

A step-by-step tutorial on the use of the "Manage Images" button is available in the WebTPAX Knowledge Base at : https://cg.portal.uscg.mil/units/ppc/WebTPAX/AttachingDocuments.aspx.

Add your documents (PDF format) in three steps 

New, Streamlined Audit Process

By using the "Manage Images" button in WEBTPAX, all required TDY Travel documents (original orders, receipts, etc.) can be attached to the traveler's claim when submitted within the system. 

If the member's travel claim is selected for a post-payment audit, the traveler will receive a courtesy email notification of the impending audit - no action will be required at that time. Should additional documentation be required (or if documentation was not provided with the initial submission) the member will be given 30 business days to scan and attach the required documentation. PPC will build a debt for all or any portion of the claim if the required documentation is not received. PPC will no longer send out 2nd, 3rd, or Final Audit Requests. 

Travelers may request a suspension of an audit if documentation is needed and they are unable to comply due to operational commitments. Requests must be submitted to PPC Customer Care and must include the claim number and the estimated ending date of suspension. Submit requests via the PPC web site: http://www.uscg.mil/ppc/ccb/. 

Roles and Responsibilities of the Traveler

Travelers are highly encouraged to scan and attach all required TDY documentation (signed original orders, receipts, etc.) within WEBTPAX when submitting TDY claims to the authorization official. This will alleviate the need to mail documents to PPC for processing and auditing TDY claims. 

Members who do not have access to WEBTPAX or scanning capabilities are authorized to submit a manual claim through their authorization official to PPC Travel using U.S. Postal Service First Class Mail ONLY. 

Travelers are reminded they must keep copies of all travel documents for six years and three months. 

Role and Responsibilities of the Authorizing Official

Authorizing officials will continue to authorize travel, approve expenses and forward electronic claims to PPC in accordance with current policy and procedures. Authorizing officials are still required to physically review the original orders and all required receipts for the advance or settlement request prior to electronically approving claims. Additionally, the authorizing official must also ensure all required documents are attached, valid, and readable within WEBTPAX. 

Looking Ahead

PPC is actively testing WEBTPAX for submitting Permanent Change of Station (PCS) claims. When authorized, this will allow members to input their PCS travel claims directly into WEBTPAX for approval, submission, and processing at PPC. This electronic process will greatly reduce travel claim examination and reimbursement time. In addition to accelerated payments, this will also drastically reduce the costs of postage and resources associated with traditional mailing methods.

CG Department Run - Last Review Date Negative Number Error

Published Date: Tue, 02 Jun 2015 12:30:01 CDT


Some users are receiving the an error ("Negative number assigned to an unsigned field") when running the department run report and clicking "Last Review Dt". 

negative number errorThis error occurs when one of the employees in the report has a future dated employee review date, and therefore the calculation for the "Num Days" column results in a negative number. When the error occurs, the population of the review date and number of days stops at the point of the error and does not post for the remainder of the members on the report. It will not be uncommon for employees to have future dated employee reviews, so this report will be modified to accept a negative number.

Travel Orders Numbers and Accounting Data No Longer Included on Separation or Retirement Orders

Published Date: Mon, 01 Jun 2015 14:30:01 CDT


Direct Access no longer automatically adds a Travel Order Number(TONO)/Line of Accounting(LOA) to Separation and Retirement Orders. TONOs/LOAs are now added by DCMS-831 (PCS TONO Funds Manager) if the member elects to relocate upon separation/retirement to their Home of Record/Home of Selection. This change will ensure that the Coast Guard only allocates funds to members who are actually moving/incurring costs. 

New Process for Adding a Separation/Retirement TONO/LOA to DA Orders
1.Ensure member has firm plans to relocate upon separation. They should not request a TONO "just in case" as there is a process in place to request a TONO at a later time. See para 6 below for details. 
2.E-mail tonomanagement@uscg.mil with the following information (multiple requests in one e-mail are encouraged): A.Rank and Name 
B.EMPLID 
C.Orders Trans ID 
D.Type of orders (Separation or Retirement) 
E.From City, State to City, State (e.g. Arlington, VA to Elko, NV) 

3.Allow up to 3 business days for DCMS-831 to add the TONO. Once added, it will appear on the orders in DA. 
4.If TONO must be added ASAP (same day separation), contact PSC-BOPS-C at ARL-DG-M-CGPSC-BOPS-C@uscg.mil. 
5.SPOs are still required to use the "SRT" order note on Separation and Retirement orders. 
6.The process to request a TONO if the member decides to relocate at a later date will remain the same: A.Member must ensure the request for a new TONO and relocation dates are within the original entitlement timeline. Requests for an extension must be submitted to CG-1332. 
B.Member must request a new TONO from CGPSC-BOPS-C by emailing ARL-DG-M-CGPSC-BOPS-C@uscg.mil. CGPSC-BOPS-C will send the member an amendment to their orders containing the new TONO and LOA. This does not constitute a change to their entitlement timeline. 

7.Contacts: A.DCMS-831: LCDR Kevin Crecy, AFC-20 Funds Manager 
B.PSC-BOPS-C: YNC Jennifer Knapp or YN1 Steven Lopez

BAH Codes for Singe Members in Government Quarters

Published Date: Fri, 22 May 2015 10:30:01 CDT


We updated the description for BAH Code "E" to inculde the following note "Includes Leased housing and government (DOD or CG) owned Family quarters that have been converted to UPH" 

This code must be used when a single member is assigned leased housing or government (DOD or CG) owned Family quarters that have been converted to UPH. 

A member without dependents is not authorized BAH-Partial when assigned to Government leased quarters or Government family-type quarters. This includes family-type Government quarters that have been converted to single-type unaccompanied personnel housing (UPH) quarters. 

BAH Code "D", which pays BAH-Partial, is only used when a single member is assigned shipboard berthing or barracks.

Increase in Discount Meal Rate Deductions Implemented

Published Date: Thu, 21 May 2015 11:30:01 CDT


ALCOAST 172/15; Coast Guard Food Service Meal Rate Changes, announced changes in the meal rates effective 1 May 2015. These changes were implemented in Direct Access and are reflected in the May mid-month payday. 

Prior to 1 May 2015, members whose duty assignment requires automatic pay account meal charge deductions (Daily DMR Deductions) - enlisted personnel on sea duty and CG Class A School trainees - were charged $10.45/day in Calendar 2105. Starting 1 May 2105, the automatic pay account deduction became the CG Standard Meal Rate (CGSMR) and the daily charge is now $11.85 - an increase of $1.40/day. This increased meal rate deduction will reduce net pay for affected personnel by $42.00 each 30-day month, $43.40 each 31-day month, and $39.20 in February ($40.60 in Leap Years). 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change in Policy for Rental Cars

Published Date: Thu, 21 May 2015 11:30:01 CDT


The Federal Register has published the Final Rule FTR Amendment on POV and Rental Car Policy (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-05-13/pdf/2015-11459.pdf). 

This Amendment to the Federal Travel Regulation requires rental of the least expensive compact cars (with minor exceptions) by Federal employees. In addition, the Rule requires, prior to authorizing use of POV, that agencies analyze the comparison of rental car costs to evaluate the least cost mode of transportation; rental car or POV. Lastly, the Amendment explicitly restricts employees from being reimbursed for pre-payment of fuel for rental cars. 

The amendment is effective 13 May 2015.

DA Open and Closed Defects 1 May 2015

Published Date: Fri, 01 May 2015 13:30:01 CDT


This spreadsheet shows open defects and defects closed within the past month as of today. 
•DA Defects Open and Closed.xlsx

Recently added defects
•Orders for Fleet Ups and Extensions (24 March 2015) - There have been some issues with no cost orders for fleet ups and extensions that have auto-stopped BAH and COLA (INCONUS, OUTCONUS, and Partial) entitlements when they should continue to run. Defect #2676 has been created for this condition. Until this is resolved SPOs must review the member's pay the day of PCS departure to ensure it is continuing station allowances (BAH and COLA) as the system procedures state it will (and should). SPOs simply need to change any rows marked by the system as "inactive" back to "active". 

Recently resolved either by code correction or by procedure update
•Unit Roster (22 April 2015) - The "BAH Description" runs into the next column (RES Screen Dt.) if the description has a comma in it. This affects the alignment of the remaining columns for the person. To correct, right-click in the cell that has the 2nd part of the BAH Description (The RES Screen Dt. column) and delete it. Select "shift cells left" and then, click OK. 
•Unit Roster (25 March 2015) - Unit roster not displaying leave balances and name only in one column - Resolved. 
•PHS Officer Weigh-In Info (14 April 2015) - IAW COMDTINST M1080.8 (series), PHS officers detailed to the CG are required to meet CG weight standards. DA 9.1 does not allow weight entries for these officers. All weight data for PHS officers need to be emailed to CAPT Wade McConnell at Wade.B.McConnell@uscg.mil. CAPT McConnell will enter the data when this issue is fixed. Until this issue is resolved, PHS officers may show as non-compliant on rosters and/or queries. 
•Tax Withholding (24 March 2015) - A change has been implemented to allow additional withholdings without putting the member in a Net Negative Pay status. Prior to this change, Reserve component members who elected to have additional tax withheld would be put in a negative pay status if they didn't have any earnings (e.g. Didn't drill) during the pay period. 
•DMR Refund for Missed Meals (24 March 2015) - Do not submit a Meal Rate Request for periods of leave. Doing so will duplicate reimbursement and cause an overpayment to the member. The leave transaction will automatically reimburse missed meals for the leave period. 
•DMR Refund for Missed Meals (24 March 2015) - Do not enter discount meal rate refunds for 1 May or later until the mid-month May pay calendar is open (following the payroll finalized date of 22 April, for the end-month April pay day). Due to the way the system processes refunds for missed meal transactions, SPOs must not future date discount meal rate refund transactions. The system uses the rate table in effect the date the transaction is generated. Transactions entered with 1 May or later dates will use the old rate table if built prior to the mid-month May pay calendar being open. Any refunds for missed meals which span April and May must be input as two separate transactions. One for the rate in effect for 30 April and prior and one for the rate in effect for 1 May and later. 
•Orders (24 March 2015) - When processing retroactive PCS transactions (those with effective dates prior to 1 January 2015), SPOs must manually stop Cost of Living Allowances (INCONUS, OUTCONUS and partial) effective the date of the member's PCS departure and also stop the 1 January 2015 legislative pay change row. The system will not auto-stop these entitlements.

Alaska Marine Highway - Effective Immediately Changes to Military Holds and cancel/change policy

Published Date: Fri, 01 May 2015 12:30:01 CDT


Effective immediately, copies of orders need to be into SATO to secure any Alaska Marine Highway (AMH) ferry reservations or the reservation may be canceled automatically. 

AMH has changed their policies for payments. For reservations made more than 28 days from the date of departure, payment is due 14 days from the date of booking. If the booking date is less than 28 days prior to the departure date-payment is due 14 days prior to travel. (Ex: if the booking date is 18 days prior to travel, the customer is allowed 4 days to pay or the booking will be auto canceled.) If the booking is made less than 14 days prior to the departure date - payment is due at the time of booking. Payment must be made by the payment due date or the reservation will be automatically canceled. 

CWTSatoTravel has 510 AMH bookings. They are currently going through each reservation and calling payment into AMH to avoid cancellation. Where they have not received orders yet they are contacting those members to send their orders in immediately. Since this is a busy time of year and most sailings are completely full, they are working diligently to ensure the members reservations remain valid. However, Coast Guard travelers are encouraged to contact SATO at 800-753-7286 and select the prompt for the Alaska Marine Highway ferry to confirm orders are on file. 

There is no penalty to change or cancel for Government or Military reservations.

The guide provides procedures for starting BAH when there's an existing BAH row (Tip: Do not mark the existing row as "inactive", follow the procedure in the guide and insert a new row) and adds the requirement to enter "99999" for the zip code when the member is only entitled to non-locality BAH (BAH codes "W" and "X"). Guidance on the use of the "Notepad" feature is also included to ensure all transactions are properly documented.

Members should not set up automated payments or assume funds will be available prior to published paydays. Members should verify with their financial institutions as to the actual time funds are available to their account. 

Per ALCOAST 497/14 (Para. 3), customers are directed to contact their P&A Office for any errors or questions on pay and/or personnel issues. If the P&A Office cannot resolve it, the P&A Office is to contact the servicing SPO. If the serving SPO cannot resolve the issues, the SPO will contact PPC. Customers should not be contacting PPC directly for any pay or personnel issues. We will continue to reroute inquiries directly from customers back to the serving SPO, AND contact the servicing SPO Chief to inform them that the ticket was rerouted.

Leave on Separation Orders

Published Date: Thu, 16 Apr 2015 16:30:01 CDT


Remember to only use the leave type of Terminal Leave when completing separation orders in Direct Access. If the regular leave type is used it will not shut down entitlements and causes other problems with the transaction.

leave row on sep order

Also, remember SPOs MUST manually stop Career Sea Pay, Career Sea Pay Premium and OUTCONUS COLA upon the member's departure from the unit on Terminal Leave (with no intention to return) to prevent overpayments. 

More Separations Reminders: 
•Do not put leave to sell in the carry forward block. Direct Access will sell all available leave upon separation processing. There is no "leave to sell" block. The carry forward block is only used for members continuing on another active duty contract with less than 24 hours break in service and for reserve component members being released from active duty. 
•Approve separations as soon as complete and not later than two days prior to the SPO Data Entry / Approval cutoff for the pay period of the separation. You can approve separations right up to the SPO Data Entry / Approval cutoff, but two days prior is preferred. Do not approve separations during the "blackout" period between the SPO Data Entry / Approval cutoff and "Payroll finalized Date" unless requested to do so by PPC.

To date, 40% (104 auditors) have NOT completed the requirements. Successful completion of both courses must reflect in CGBI. After they reflect in CGBI, members must submit a new CG-7421B to PPC. Members that are not compliant by COB Apr 30th will lose their CGHRSUP role. Up to 14 SPO's may essentially be shut down. Don't wait till the last minute to get this done, exceptions will not be granted.

Using Your Government Travel Charge Card on Non-CG Funded Travel

Published Date: Thu, 09 Apr 2015 11:00:01 CDT


Government Travel Charge Card holders may use their cards for non-Coast Guard funded official government travel (travel funded by other federal entities such as DOD). 

If you used your card on non-CG funded official travel, do not request split disbursement when completing your travel claim with other government agencies. The will result in payment delays if the other agency uses a different travel charge contract. 

See ALCGPSC 042/15; Use of the GTCC for Non-Coast Guard Funded Official Government Travel, for more information. 

Reminder; Government Travel Charge Card bills must be paid in full on or before the statement due date regardless of the timeliness of the reimbursement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advance Pay, BAH and OHA - Pay Period vs. Pay Date

Published Date: Fri, 10 Apr 2015 11:00:01 CDT


All dates in the Advance Pay action request are pay period begin dates. To have an advance payout on the 1st of a month, you must enter the pay period begin date for the end-month pay date, which is the 16th of the previous month. 

Example: If the Advance is to pay out on 1 May 2015, the payment date is 16 April 2015. 

Also, both the Payment Date and the Repayments Start date fields may be left blank. If these fields are left blank, payment will be made on the pay date for the current payroll calendar and the repayment will begin one month later. 

See the Payroll Calendars topic in the DA Knowledge Base for pay period begin dates. 

Reminder: Per the CG Pay Manual, Sec. 9-D, the advance of pay may not be paid prior to 30 days before departing on PCS orders.

Government Travel Charge Card Program Updates and PCS Reminders

Published Date: Thu, 09 Apr 2015 12:00:01 CDT


UNCLAS //N04600// 
ALCGPSC 043/15 
SUBJ: GTCC PROGRAM UPDATES AND PCS SEASON REMINDERS 
A. Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) Program Policies and Procedures, COMDTINST M4600.18 (SERIES) 
1.This message seeks to raise awareness of general programmatic concerns and provide general guidance as we move into the summer transfer season. 
2.Travel Card Use. In general cardholders are required to use their travel card for all authorized, reimbursable travel expenses unless specifically exempt in REF A. These exemptions include Temporary Duty (TDY) of more than 21 days, Permanent Change of Station (PCS) duration of over 15 days, cases where the card is not accepted by the vendor, or prohibited such as group meals where the check cannot be split. Provided below are specific examples where card use is not authorized: A.Permissive Orders. Permissive orders do not include reimbursement for travel expenses and therefore card use is prohibited. 
B.Team Gear or Equipment. Government material required by multiple members of a group or team is not considered a reimbursable travel expense for an individual member and must be paid for by other procurement methods. 
C.Tuition. While conference registration fees including those for training conferences are reimbursable travel expenses, tuition for regularly scheduled courses are not covered. 
D.Local Travel. The travel card can only be used when the cardholder has travel orders and is not authorized for local travel expenses. 
E.TDY Over 21 Days. For TDY travel over 21 days, the travel card shall not be used unless interim travel claims are submitted at least every 21 days which requires the travel orders to be document type 13 orders. 

3.Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Issues. Relocation to a new duty station can be both exciting and stressful on the member and the family. Provided below are a few helpful reminders to ensure cardholders use their travel card correctly during the move: A.PCS Duration. If the duration of the PCS travel will exceed 15 days, including leave, compensatory absence, proceed-time, and temporary duty in conjunction with the PCS, the card shall not be used. This does not apply to Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA). The card may be used to cover hotels and meals in conjunction with the TLA entitlement, but reimbursement claims must be submitted every 15 days to allow for timely payment of the GTCC bill. In the case of Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE), card use is subject to the 15-day rule addressed above. If PCS travel duration will exceed 15 days, ensure the traveler requests a travel advance to cover the expenses. 
B.Dependent Travel. The GTCC shall not be used for dependent travel expenses such as meals, lodging, and transportation tickets. Instead members should request travel advances and ensure their PCS travel orders authorize the use of the Centrally Billed Account (CBA) for dependent travel. 
C.Leisure in Conjunction with Official Travel. Use of the members GTCC or the CBA and the GSA contracted fares for travel other than between official duty stations is not authorized. Special rules and fare restrictions apply to leisure in conjunction with official travel. Travelers are encouraged to review the Leisure in Conjunction with Orders FAQ sheet available at www.uscg.mil/psc/bops/govtrvl/Traveler/LICWO-FAQ.pdf or contact their Servicing Personnel Office (SPO) prior to booking any leisure travel. 
D.Transportation of Household Goods. The GTCC is not authorized for the transportation of household goods (for example: U Haul rental), privately owned vehicles, mobile homes and boats per REF A. This includes Personally Procured Moves (PPM). 
E.Trailers/Recreational Vehicles (RV). Movement of a trailer (boat, camper, UHaul) or even driving an RV is not a reimbursable travel expense and therefore associated expenses are not authorized to be charged to the CBA or the IBA. This is particularly important for travel within the northwest that involves the Alaska Marine Highway System. This would be considered part of a Do It Yourself (DITY) move and reimbursable under a separate process. 
F.Credit Limit Increases. As part of your travel preparations, travelers should verify that the credit limit on their GTCC is sufficient to meet their authorized, reimbursable travel expenses. Cardholders can view their credit limit in Direct Access under the Self-Service, Employee, View, My Credit Card Data or by contacting their Travel Manager who can also increase the limit if needed. 
G.Address Update. GTCC cardholders are reminded that they need to contact the bank following their PCS move an update their address in the bank system. The bank may be reached by calling the number on the back of the GTCC, 888-297-0781. 

4.All questions should be directed as follows: A.Cardholders shall direct GTCC questions to their unit GTCC Travel Manager. Members can determine who their supporting Travel Managers are under the contacts page located at www.uscg.mil/psc/bops/govtrvl/. 
B.GTCC Travel Managers: direct questions to Ms. Carlene Curry at 703-258-5996 or Evelyn.C.Curry@uscg.mil or Mr. Matt Ruckert at 703-201-3080 or Matthew.T.Ruckert@uscg.mil.

Semiannual Weight and Body Fat Screening

Published Date: Thu, 02 Apr 2015 11:00:01 CDT


Data Entry Tips

Per Coast Guard Weight and Body Fat Standards Program Manual, COMDTINST M1020.8 (series), all Coast Guard military personnel shall be screened against weight and body fat standards every April and October. 

Keep these key points in mind when entering measurements in Direct Access: 

Height: Round measurements to the nearest whole number. Examples: 65.4 is recorded in DA as 65; 65.5 is recorded in DA as 66. 

Weight: Round measurements to the nearest whole number. Examples: 215.4 is recorded in DA as 215; 215.5 is recorded in DA as 216. 

CG Repose Boat
Response Boat-Medium, Length: 45 feet, Displacement: 36,500 pounds

The height and weight fields in DA are free text - there are no edits. 

We've found measurements in the system for 45-foot tall, 16,000-pound monsters. Remember, we're recording the measurements of humans, not Response boats! 

The system will not check for these errors, you must check your own work! 

PPC has step-by-step data entry procedures available at http://www.uscg.mil/ppc/gp/PersonProfile/Member_Weigh-In_Data.htm 

And, http://www.uscg.mil/ppc/da/HeightWeightMeasurement.pdf 

Be sure to follow these data entry procedures in addition to the guidance provided in Coast Guard Weight and Body Fat Standards Program Manual, COMDTINST M1020.8 (series).

How to Lookup the SPO for a Unit in Direct Access

Published Date: Wed, 01 Apr 2015 11:30:01 CDT


YN1 Aragoni, Base National Capital Region, discovered a quick and easy way to locate a unit's assigned SPO using the CG Dept Run tab off the Airport Terminal. His procedure guide is linked below. 

How to Lookup a unit's SPOfile in pdf format 

Simply enter the unit's department ID and select the "HRS" relationship type. This will show the unit's assigned SPO. We thought the HRS relationship type wouldn't return any results if the department ID entered wasn't for a SPO. Turns out the CG Dept Run provides a reverse lookup function when used this way. 

Our thanks to YN1 Aragoni for passing this tip along! His method provides real-time results as opposed to the Unit Relationship report we post on the SPO Contact List web page, which is only updated quarterly. 

We are working with Comdt (CG-631) and the project management office in CG-1 to find a way to make SPO mailing addresses available to users within Direct Access. Until a method is provided, you'll have to use the Standard Distribution List, COMDTNOTE 5605, and lookup mailing addresses.

Researching Payment of IDT drills

Published Date: Wed, 01 Apr 2015 10:30:01 CDT


Quick tip on researching IDT drills and trying to figure out if someone was paid for a drill (what day they were paid for). 

In the Pay Calculations Results page, you may be used to doing the bulk of your research in the Earnings and Deductions tab, but there you'll find no indication of what drill dates are being paid. However, if you select the Positive Input-Payroll link found in the Calendar Group Results tab, you can then select the "Other Data" link next to the IDT Drill in question. That will take you to a page that tells you the begin date of the drill! 

The Viewing IDT Drill Pay Calculations guidepdf icon provides step-by-step procedures for researching IDT payments.

Shipping a Second Privately Owned (Motor) Vehicle within the Contiguous United States

Published Date: Wed, 01 Apr 2015 10:00:01 CDT


By CWO J. R. Jeffery, COMDT (CG-1332), HHG Transportation Program Manager 

COMDT (CG-1332) received feedback that SPO yeoman may have incorrectly advised members regarding reimbursement for shipping a Privately Owned (Motor) Vehicle (POV) in the Contiguous United States (CONUS). The following information is to ensure that all yeoman understand when a member is entitled to reimbursement for shipping a POV in CONUS, and when they are not. 

In accordance with Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), par. 5322-B and Coast Guard Supplement to the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (CGS-JFTR), COMDTINST M4600.17 (series), par. 5414-A, for a member to be reimbursed for shipping a POV in CONUS, the member must have a dependent(s), the member or their dependent(s) must possess more than one POV to be relocated to the new PDS, and the member and their dependent(s) must travel together, at one time, in a Privately Owned Conveyance (POC) to the new Permanent Duty Station (PDS). If a member meets these criteria they may be entitled to reimbursement for shipping their second POV in CONUS. However, if a member chooses to utilize commercial transportation for themselves or their dependent(s) to the new PDS the member does not meet these criteria and they are not entitled to reimbursement for shipping a second POV in CONUS. 

When a member meets the criteria of JTR 5322-B and CGS-JFTR 5414-A they are entitled to reimbursement for shipping a second POV in CONUS. However, use of a Government Vehicle Processing Center (VPC) is not authorized. The member must use a commercial POV carrier and make all arrangements for the shipment of their second POV. Travel time is not authorized to drop off, or pick up a second POV, and the member may not be reimbursed for mileage to drop off, or pick up a second POV transported IAW JTR 5322-B and CGS-JFTR, par. 5414-A. Also, the Government is not responsible for any damages or missed delivery dates caused by a commercial POV carrier. 

When a member is entitled to reimbursement for shipping a second POV in CONUS the calculations and maximum reimbursable amount must be reflected on the member's PCS orders. See JTR par. 5328 for examples of how to calculate a members reimbursable amount to ship a second POV in CONUS. 

Yeoman should counsel members if they do not meet the above criteria, and do not travel together with their dependents at one time in a POC, then the member is not entitled reimbursement for shipping a second POV in CONUS. Yeoman should also counsel members that falsifying a DD-1351/2 to reflect the member and their dependent(s) traveled together at one time in a POC, when they didn't is fraud.

March End-Month Payroll Processing Complete

Published Date: Tue, 31 Mar 2015 11:30:01 CDT


"Payslips" for 1 April pay day posted. Report any discrepancies through the P&A Office (Admin) to the SPO. If SPOs cannot address or need assistance, the SPO will submit trouble ticket. Payslips can be accessed via the Self-Service "View" menu. Refer to this guide for an overview of the new payslip. 

The military payday for End-Month March is 1 April. Payday falls on the 1st and 15th of each month unless that date is a weekend or federal legal holiday. In those cases, the payday is moved to the 1st preceding business day. For the 2015 schedule of military paydays visit: http://www.uscg.mil/ppc/mas.asp#2015. 

Members should not set up automated payments or assume funds will be available prior to published paydays. Members should verify with their financial institutions as to the actual time funds are available to their account. 

Per ALCOAST 497/14 (Para. 3), customers are directed to contact their P&A Office for any errors or questions on pay and/or personnel issues. If the P&A Office cannot resolve it, the P&A Office is to contact the servicing SPO. If the serving SPO cannot resolve the issues, the SPO will contact PPC. Customers should not be contacting PPC directly for any pay or personnel issues. We will continue to reroute inquiries directly from customers back to the serving SPO, AND contact the servicing SPO Chief to inform them that the ticket was rerouted.

Known Issue With PCS Orders for Fleet Ups and Extensions

Published Date: Fri, 27 Mar 2015 09:00:01 CDT


There have been some issues with no cost orders for fleet ups and extensions that have auto-stopped BAH and COLA (INCONUS, OUTCONUS, and Partial) entitlements when they should continue to run. Defect #2676 has been created for this condition. 

Until this is resolved SPOs must review the member's pay the day of PCS departure to ensure it is continuing station allowances (BAH and COLA) as the system procedures state it will (and should). SPOs simply need to change any rows marked by the system as "inactive" back to "active".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Submitting Trouble Tickets With Supporting Images

Published Date: Thu, 26 Mar 2015 13:00:01 CDT


To better assist all of you, we need you to provide detailed information when you submit a trouble ticket. You need to provide EMPLIDs, what the error is, what you are changing, updating, and/or entering, etc. Screen shots would be EXTREMELY helpful. Screen shots will give us a better picture of which component you are in and the error that you are getting. Providing detailed information with screen shots will help us resolve tickets at a much faster pace and ultimately get your members paid quicker. 

Follow the procedures in the "Submitting Trouble Tickets With Supporting Images guide in pdf format" customer guide when submitting trouble tickets with screen shots or other supporting documentation. Do not include screen shots in the body of an e-mail message to PPC Customer Care. The images will not be imported into our tracking system.

Voluntary Additional Tax Withholding for Reserve Component Members

Published Date: Tue, 24 Mar 2015 13:00:01 CDT


A change has been implemented to allow additional withholdings without putting the member in a Net Negative Pay status. Prior to this change, Reserve component members who elected to have additional tax withheld would be put in a negative pay status if they didn't have any earnings (e.g. Didn't drill) during the pay period.

SPOs Must Stop COLA for Retroactive PCS Transactions

Published Date: Tue, 24 Mar 2015 13:00:01 CDT


When processing retroactive PCS transactions (those with effective dates prior to 1 January 2015), SPOs must manually stop Cost of Living Allowances (INCONUS, OUTCONUS and partial) effective the date of the member's PCS departure and also stop the 1 January 2015 legislative pay change row. The system will not auto-stop these entitlements for PCS transfers with effective dates prior to 1 January 2015

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Meal Rate Changes and Refund for Missed Meals

Published Date: Tue, 24 Mar 2015 13:00:01 CDT


Per ALCOAST 099/15 the following meal rates will be implemented in Direct Access effective the 1-15 May payday. 

Do not enter discount meal rate refunds for 1 May or later until the mid-month May pay calendar is open (following the payroll finalized date of 22 April, for the end-month April pay day). 

The changes are: 
•Discount Meal Rate (DMR) changes from $10.45 per day to $11.85 per day. 
•DMR refund changes to $2.55 breakfast, $4.65 lunch, $4.65 dinner 
•Inactive Duty for Training (IDT) Subsistence Allowance changes to $2.55 breakfast, $4.65 lunch, $4.65 dinner 
•Cadet Commuted Rations changes from $13.85 per day to $11.85 per day. 

Due to the way the system processes refunds for missed meal transactions, SPOs must not future date discount meal rate refund transactions. The system uses the rate table in effect the date the transaction is generated. Transactions entered with 1 May or later dates will use the old rate table if built prior to the mid-month May pay calendar being open. Any refunds for missed meals which span April and May must be input as two separate transactions. One for the rate in effect for 30 April and prior and one for the rate in effect for 1 May and later.

DD Form 214 Formatting and Data Entry

Published Date: Wed, 18 Mar 2015 17:30:01 CDT


When completing blocks 13 (Decorations, Medals, and Awards) and 14 (Military Education) use only semi-colons (;) to separate entries. Do not use commas to separate entries as this will force the everything before the comma to be pushed to the continuation page if the block on the form is full. If a semi-colon is present, the system will break the line at the semi-colon when moving text to the continuation page. 

Also, and this applies to all text areas on the DD-214 data entry component, you cannot use tabs or excessive spaces to format entries. Only paragraphs and manual line breaks can be used. 

Additional guidance for completing the DD-214 is available in Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214/5 Series), Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 1336.01. The Coast Guard DD-214 Manual (CIM 1900.4 (series)) is being reviewed and will be released in the near future. It will defer to the DoDI for data entry. So follow the DoDI when completing the DD-214. This includes: 
•Personnel being separated from a period of active duty for training, full-time training duty, or active duty for special work will be furnished a DD Form 214 when they have served 90 days or more, or when required by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned for shorter periods. Personnel shall be furnished a DD Form 214 upon separation for cause or for physical disability regardless of the length of time served on active duty. 

 (1) Reserve Component personnel ordered to active duty for a contingency operation will be issued a DD Form 214 regardless of the number of days served on active duty. 
 (2) The DD Form 214 issuance requirement shall also apply to recalled retirees reverting to retired status, regardless of the period of active duty served. 
•For Service members (active and reserve) retiring or separating from active duty, participation in contingency operations will be documented in Block 18 of the DD Form 214. 
•The only authorized entries in Block 24, "Character of Service" are 

(1) Honorable. 
(2) Under Honorable Conditions (For General discharge). 
(3) Under Other Than Honorable Conditions. 
(4) Bad Conduct. 
(5) Dishonorable. 
(6) Uncharacterized. 
•Block 27: The "Reentry Code" (RE code) is not applicable to officers or cadets. Leave this field blank for officers and cadets, it will show as "N/A" on the PDF output of the form. 
•Block 28 shall only state the Narrative Reason found in the separation Program Designator (SPD) Code Handbook. 
•Block 29: The Direct Access generated DD Form 214 leaves block 29, "Dates of Time Lost During This Period" blank if nothing is entered. This is contrary to the guidance in COMDTINST M1900.4 (series), which states the word "NONE" should be entered in this block if the member doesn't have any lost time. This issue was communicated to Commandant (CG-1331), Military Policy and Standards Division. They have approved a variance to the guidance to allow block 29 of the DD-214 to be left blank if the member doesn't have any lost time during the period covered by the form. 
•Distribution of Finalized DD-214. Continue mailing copies 3, 5, and 6 of the DD-214 (as described in DoDI 1336.01). The VA main office, VA state offices, and Dept. of Labor do not have full access yet to the DMDC data. Until they have full e-capability, SPOs must continue mailing copies 3,5, and 6 to ensure no drop off in the interim. This is of course in addition to the members copies mailed to their final address.

Allotment Processing and Payroll Calendar Cutoff Dates

Published Date: Mon, 16 Mar 2015 16:00:01 CDT


Allotments are processed according to the following rules: 
•Start allotment: The start date is always the 1st of the month. If a member starts an allotment during the mid-month calendar, the start date will default to the 1st day of the current month. If the member starts an allotment during the end-month calendar, the start date must be greater than or equal to the 1st day of the next month. 
•Stop allotment: The stop date is always the last day of the month. If a member stops an allotment during the mid-month calendar, the stop date will default to the last day of the previous month. If the member stops an allotment during the end-month calendar, the stop date must be greater than or equal to the last day of the current month. 
•Change allotment amount: If a member changes an allotment during the mid-month calendar, the change in amount date will default to the 1st day of the current month. If the member changes the amount during the end-month calendar, the change date must be greater than or equal to the 1st day of the next month. 
•Change distribution information(acct #/routing #): The change date must be greater than or equal to the 1st day of the current month. This is true for either the mid-month or end-month calendar. 

Starts/Stops, or Changes to the amount cannot be a retro date based on the current open pay calendar. 

Changes to the acct/routing can be made at any time and the monies will be sent to the information listed when the end-month payroll is finalized.

Avoiding Expected Active Duty Termination Date Payroll Errors

Published Date: Mon, 16 Mar 2015 12:30:01 CDT


Introduction:

End of enlistment processing has changed with the implementation of DA Global Pay. Under Global Pay, if a member's end of enlistment falls within the current pay calendar, there must be an approved separation order or approved retention document (reenlistment/extension/re-extension) before payroll for the Coast Guard can be finalized.

Error Condition:

If a member's end of enlistment falls within the pay calendar and an approved separation or approved retention document is not completed prior to payroll finalization, the member will be removed form payroll and will not receive pay and allowances for that pay cycle. SPOs are responsible for completing the appropriate action in Direct Access after payroll finalizes and the next pay calendar is opened. SPOs must then request a special payment for retained members. 

Effect on reenlistments, extensions and re-extensions:

Reenlistments, extensions and re-extensions for the current pay calendar cannot be executed after payroll finalization since they cannot be approved until the date of signing.
•For example, a member with an end of enlistment on 28 March 2015 cannot sign a reenlistment contract on 27 March 2015 since payroll finalization occurs on 23 March 2015. ◦The member must reenlist on or before the SPO data entry cutoff date (18 March 2015).


When counseling members on reenlistment/extension/re-extension, it is imperative that PA Offices and SPOs refer to the  payroll calendar to ensure the contract is executed prior to the SPO data entry/approval cutoff date for the pay calendar in which the end of enlistment falls.

Reminder: Per 1.B.7.b.(4) Military Separations, COMDTINST M1000.4 (series), commanding officers are authorized to separate members three or fewer months before the normal separation date for the purpose of immediate reenlistment.

SPO Notification/Action:

PPC Separations (SEP) ensures all expected active duty termination date payroll errors are clear prior to payroll finalization. SPO's will receive an email from PPC-PF-SEP@uscg.mil indicating immediate action is needed and will follow up with any additional actions needed throughout the applicable pay calendar. These actions must be completed by the SPO data entry cutoff date.

Approval after SPO Cutoff Date:

If PPC (SEP) directs the approval of a separation or contract after the SPO cutoff date but before payroll finalization, SPOs must comply as the pending transaction causes a payroll error that prevents payroll from finalizing.

Separations Approvals:

All separation orders must be approved by the SPO data entry/approval cutoff date of the member's departure from the unit. Examples: 
•The separation orders for a member separating on 30 April 2015 and departing on 25 March 2015, must be approved not later than 18 March 2015. 
•A separation order for a member separating on 30Apr who is not taking terminal leave must be approved not later than 17 April 2015.

NOTE: SPOs must manually stop CSEAPAY, CSEAPAY PREMIUM, OCOLAand SDAP for members taking terminal leave. 

Unapproved Separations:

If a separating member's separation is not approved, prior to payroll finalization, the member's final pay and allowances will be removed from the payroll cycle. 

Final pay and allowances (including lump sum leave sell) will be delayed as it must be manually recomputed and added to an off cycle payment after payroll finalization.

Guidance for Personally Procured Movements of Household Goods

Published Date: Fri, 13 Mar 2015 11:00:01 CDT


UNCLAS //N04050// 
ALCOAST 090/15 
COMDTNOTE 4050 

SUBJ: Personally Procured Movements (PPM) of Household Goods (HHG) 

A. Joint Travel Regulations 
1.Transfer season 2015 is just around the corner, and so is the household goods (HHG) transportation peak season. The period 15 May through 15 July is the peak of the HHG transportation season. During this time period it may be difficult to secure government contracted transportation service providers (TSP) that meet everyones desired packing, pick-up, and delivery dates. 
2.If a TSP cannot be contracted, or if a member prefers, they may conduct a full or partial personally procured move (PPM) of their HHGs. By properly conducting a PPM, members may receive an incentive payment of 95 percent of what it would have cost the government to transport the member's HHG in one lot between authorized locations. Incentive payments will be based on the actual HHG weight moved, not to exceed the member's maximum allowable weight. 
3.To prevent delays or denial of PPM incentive payments, commands should ensure that all members departing on permanent change of station (PCS) orders, or separating from the Coast Guard receive a printed copy of this ALCOAST. It is the member's responsibility to understand their entitlements and the requirements contained in this ALCOAST. To ensure members receive proper HHG counseling, commands are strongly encouraged to include HHGs counseling on their PCS check in/out sheets. No waivers to the requirements in this ALCOAST may be approved. 
4.In February 2009, the Defense Personal Property System (DPS) became the primary system used to arrange most HHG shipments and requires a user name and password. Members using DPS for the first time must go to http://www.move.mil/ and select the "First Time Users Click Here" link to register for a DPS user name and password. After registration it will take up to 72 hours for members to receive their DPS user name and password, so members should plan ahead. Members conducting their first or last HHGs movement should see a TO, to set up their move. 
5.Exceeding HHG weight limits is the number one reason members pay excess costs for HHG shipments. Members conducting both a PPM and a government funded HHG move must be aware of their maximum HHG weight allowance found in 5200-B of REF (A). To reduce HHG weight and prevent excess costs, members should dispose of any unwanted or unneeded HHG. To help estimate HHG weights, a weight estimating tool is available at www.move.mil. To find the weight estimating tool a member should select the "Before You Move" link and then select the "Weight Allowances" link on the left hand side of the screen. Members married to members may be able to combine their HHG weights and should ensure their HHG counselor is aware of their status as a member married to another member. 
6.DPS may not be available underway, or if available, it may be very slow. If members assigned afloat cannot schedule their HHG movements they may see their legal assistance office or transportation office to grant a trusted agent a special power of attorney to schedule their HHG movements while underway. 
7.Members wishing to conduct a full or partial PPM must contact their origin TO for PPM counseling and issuance of an "Application for Do-It-Yourself Move" and Counseling Checklist, DD Form 2278. Without a DD Form 2278 approved by a TO and signed by the member at origin, a PPM is considered to be an after-the-fact PPM. After-the-fact PPMs are only authorized when circumstances beyond a member's control prevents them from receiving proper PPM counseling. Circumstances beyond a member's control are considered to be severe weather conditions (e.g., hurricanes, flooding), automobile accidents, medical emergencies, or very short fused PCS orders (report within days). Without the existence of circumstances beyond a member's control after-the-fact PPM claims may only receive actual cost reimbursement (ACR) for any authorized expenditures. 
8.Members have several options when conducting a PPM which includes contracting their own TSP, contracting a you-load, they-drive service, or a member may use a personally owned or rental vehicle, and/or a personally owned or rental trailer to transport their own HHGs. Members may see their local HHG transportation office to determine their estimated incentive payment, based on their estimated HHG weight, and current and new permanent duty station (PDS), home of record, or home of selection locations to determine if they may benefit financially by conducting a PPM. 
9.Members contracting their own TSP should be aware that full replacement value insurance may not be included, and they must settle any damage claims themselves with their contracted TSP. If a member desires insurance beyond their contracted TSPs coverage they should contact a commercial insurance provider to purchase additional insurance. Also, members contracting a you-load, they-drive service must remind the contractor this is a military PPM and unloaded and loaded weight tickets are required. 
10.To receive an incentive payment for conducting a full or partial PPM, members must provide certified unloaded and loaded weight tickets from the place of origin. Weight tickets must be annotated with the member's rank/rate, name, and EMPLID. Each weight ticket must also indicate which vehicle is being weighed, and whether the weight ticket is for an unloaded or loaded vehicle and/or trailer. Vehicle registrations are not acceptable as empty weight tickets for a PPM. 
11.Boats and their associated trailers are considered to be HHG. Members conducting a PPM of a boat and trailer are only required to have one weight ticket for the boat and trailer. However, because weight tickets reflect three axles (steer, drive, and trailer) the weight ticket must indicate that a boat and trailer was weighed. If not, the boat and trailer will appear to be an empty trailer, which is not HHGs, and the weight of the trailer axle will be subtracted from the total weight used to calculate a member's incentive payment. Claims for boats and trailers must also include a copy of the boats registration, which must be registered in the member's or their dependents name. 
12.Coast Guard members frequently receive PPM counseling from transportation offices operated by other services. To prevent any confusion on service specific requirements, all Coast Guard members conducting a full or partial PPM must visit the Coast Guard Finance Centers (FINCEN) web site at http://www.fincen.uscg.mil/dity.htm, to obtain a Coast Guard PPM check list and review the procedures to be used when weighing vehicles and/or trailers to ensure accurate PPM weights are obtained. 
13.Because shipping rates differ from location to location, if a member owns HHGs at more than one location, a DD Form 2278 is required from all locations to the new PDS, home or record, or home of selection. The member must also have two weight tickets, one unloaded and one loaded from each origin. Provided the member has a DD Form 2278 and unloaded and loaded weight tickets from all origins, they may be paid an incentive payment for all PPMs not to exceed the Governments best value cost of transporting the member's maximum HHG weight allowance in one lot between all authorized locations. 
14.Members must plan ahead to ensure that certified weight scales are available at the time and date they plan to begin their move. PPM claims without unloaded and loaded weight tickets from the place of origin may only be reimbursed for authorized actual cost. 
15.COMDT (CG-1332) POCs are CWO Randy Jeffery at 202-475-5393, james.r.jeffery(at)uscg.mil or Mr. Tony Pearson at 202-475-5368, anthony.h.pearson(at)uscg.mil.

Transfer Season 2015 Household Goods (HHG) Shipping Information

Published Date: Thu, 12 Mar 2015 11:30:16 CDT


UNCLAS //N04050// 
ALCOAST 089/15 
COMDTNOTE 4050 

SUBJ: 2015 HOUSEHOLD GOODS (HHG) INFORMATION 

A. Joint Travel Regulations 
1.The 2015 household goods (HHG) transportation season will be upon us soon, and whether a member is performing a long distance permanent change of station (PCS) move or a funded short distance move, HHG counseling is mandatory. To ensure members are aware of their HHG transportation entitlements, commands should ensure that all members departing on PCS orders, or separating from the Coast Guard in assignment year (AY) 2015 receive a printed copy of this ALCOAST. To ensure members receive proper HHG counseling, commands are strongly encouraged to include HHG counseling on their PCS check in/out sheets. Requests for short distance HHG moves, including those to or from unusually arduous sea duty, may only be authorized by COMDT (CG-1332). 
2.HHG counseling may be received in person from a transportation officer (TO), or members may self counsel using the Defense Personal Property System (DPS). After a member receives their signed PCS orders, they must visit the www.move.mil web site to register in DPS. DPS allows members and their spouses to self counsel, request HHG packing, pick-up, and delivery dates, or request authorization to conduct a personally procured HHG movement (PPM). DPS may also be used to file any needed damage claims. After a member registers in DPS, it will take up to 72 hours for them to receive a user name and password to schedule their move, so members should plan ahead. Members conducting their first or last move should visit a transportation office to set up their HHGs shipment. 
3.The time period between 15 May and 15 July is the peak of the HHG moving season. If possible, members should avoid requesting a HHG shipment during this period. It is important to note that requested dates are not guaranteed, so members should not cancel or enter into a rental agreement, lease, or buy or sell a home until they have verified with their TO and their Transportation Service Provider (TSP) that their requested dates are confirmed. 
4.DPS may not be available underway, or if available, it may be very slow. If members assigned afloat cannot schedule their HHG movements they may see their legal assistance office or transportation office to grant a trusted agent a special power of attorney to schedule their HHG movements while underway. 
5.During HHG peak season it may be difficult to secure a Government contracted TSP that meets everyone's desired packing, pick-up, and delivery dates. If a TSP cannot be contracted, or if a member prefers, they may conduct a Personally Procured Move (PPM) of their HHGs. More guidance on PPMs will be published in a separate ALCOAST. 
6.Exceeding HHG weight limits is the number one reason members pay excess costs for HHG shipments. To reduce HHG weight and prevent excess costs, members should dispose of any unwanted or unneeded HHG. To avoid paying excess weight costs members must be aware of their maximum HHG weight allowance found in 5200-B of REF (A). To help members estimate their HHG weights, a weight estimating tool is available at www.move.mil. To find the weight estimating tool a member should select the "Before You Move" link and then select the "Weight Allowances" link on the left hand side of the screen. The TSP will also estimate a member's HHG weight during the pre-move survey. After a member's HHG have been picked up, they may contact the origin personal property shipping office (PPSO) that scheduled their HHG movement to get their actual HHG weight. If a member disputes their HHG weight, they may request a witnessed or un-witnessed reweigh by contacting their TSP, or origin or destination PPSO. However, a reweigh must be requested before HHGs are delivered. It is not possible to reweigh HHGs after delivery. Members married to members may be able to combine their HHG weights and should ensure their HHG counselor is aware of their status as a member married to another member. 
7.There has been a significant change to professional books, papers, and equipment (PBP and E) entitlements, more commonly known as pro gear. Effective 1 May 2014, pro gear is limited to a maximum of 2,000 lbs. Waivers to the 2,000 lb limit cannot be authorized. Pro gear previously shipped outside the continental United States (OCONUS), will be grandfathered up to the weight shipped OCONUS until they are returned to the continental United States (CONUS). Also effective on 1 May 2014, many items previously considered pro gear will no longer be considered pro gear. Most notably, personal computer equipment and memorabilia such as awards, plaques, or other objects presented for past performances are no longer considered pro gear. 
8.Pro gear does not count towards a member's HHG weight allowance. However, all items must meet the definition of pro gear found in Appendix A, of REF (A). All pro gear must be verified by a TO, and items not meeting the description of pro gear will count towards a member's maximum HHG weight allowance. Because spousal pro gear is limited to 500 lbs, a member cannot combine their pro gear with spousal pro gear. An itemized inventory of spousal pro gear must be provided to the TO for verification at the time of counseling and must indicate the profession which the items are used for (e.g., lawyer, doctor, teacher). The itemized inventory of spousal pro gear must be certified by the member's signature. 
9.Members are responsible for ensuring pro gear is separated from HHG during packing and weighed separately during pick-up. All pro gear must be identified as such on the TSP inventory sheet at origin and the estimated weight must be entered on the Application for Shipment and/or Storage of Personal Property, DD Form 1299. Ensure the term M-PRO is used to identify the military member's pro gear and S-PRO is used to identify spousal pro gear. Each line item for pro gear must indicate M-PRO/S-PRO, cubic ft, and pounds. Pro gear cannot be claimed after the fact. There are no exceptions or waivers to this policy. 
10.Another important feature of DPS is the ability to grade a TSPs performance by submitting a Customer Satisfaction Survey (CSS). The mandatory CSS process is simple and its importance cannot be overstated. The CSS is used to document positive and negative experiences and helps determine the number of military HHG shipments a TSP will receive in the future. 
11.Damage claim submission is the responsibility of the member. Completion and submission of the Joint Statement of Loss or Damage at Delivery, DD Form 1840 by the member and TSP, and the Notice of Loss or Damage, DD Form 1840R by the member after the TSP departs does not constitute filing a claim. These forms are only used for proper notification of loss or damage to a TSP. A claim is separate and distinct, and must be submitted in a timely manner. See www.move.mil and the Coast Guard Finance Centers (FINCEN) web site www.fincen.uscg.mil/hhg.htm for guidance on HHG damage claim submissions. 
12.Full replacement value (FRV) protection applies to all Government HHG shipments. Provided a member files their damage claim with the TSP through DPS within nine months of delivery, the TSP is liable for either repair or FRV of a damaged item, whichever is less, and for the FRV cost of any lost or destroyed items. However, the TSPs liability is limited to the greater of 5,000 dollars per shipment, or four dollars times the net weight of the HHG shipment in pounds, not to exceed 50,000 dollars. If a member files a claim directly with the TSP more than nine months after delivery, the TSP is only liable for the depreciated value of the items up to a maximum of one dollar and twenty-five cents times the net weight of the shipment in pounds. To find more information on FRV a member can visit the Army Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) web site www.sddc.army.mil/pp/default.aspx.

Workaround - Getting "Reserve" to Print on Contracts 

Published Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2015 19:30:01 CST


When creating a RESERVE contract, the SPO must include a comment in the main comments field of the first tab in contract data indicating that this is a RESERVE contract. 

This will help satisfy the audit requirement of identifying the correct component of enlistment. The comment will print out and be viewable in section 8.b of page 1 of the DD form 4. 

The Contract Data - Reenlistments User Guide (PDF) also reflects this procedural workaround.

Reserve Pay ADT/IDT and Direct Access

Published Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2015 11:30:01 CST




There are similarities and slight differences between JUMPS and Direct Access when it comes to processing payments to a reservist who performs IDT and short-term ADT/ADOT during a single payroll period. 
1.If the IDT and ADT/ADOT are input and approved during the pay cycle in which performed (and prior to the payroll cycle cut-off), then they will both be paid on the scheduled pay day. EXAMPLE: A reservist performs single/multiple IDT drill on 28 Februrary and ADT-AT from 1-5 March and both are input/approved prior to 6 March; in this case, the reservist will be paid for both periods of duty in their mid-month March pay. 
2.If retroactive ADT/ADOT is input on a reservist, the Servicing Personnel Office (SPO) and reservist should expect the active duty pay to not be received for two pay cycles after the orders are approved. EXAMPLE: A reservist performs ADT-AT from 5-16 March, but the orders are not submitted until 29 March. The SPO and reservist should expect the ADT/ADOT pay to be delayed until the end-month April pay cycle (1 May pay day). If the orders had been input prior to 6 March, the reservist would have received active duty pay for 3/5 thru 3/15 in the 3/15 pay, and the 3/16 active duty pay would have been paid on 1 April. If the orders had been input prior to 19 March, the reservist would have received the 12 days of active duty pay on the 4/15 payday. 
3.If retroactive IDT is input on a reservist currently on active duty, the Servicing Personnel Office (SPO) and reservist should expect the IDT pay to not be received for two pay cycles after it is input. EXAMPLE: A reservist is in an active duty status for the 1-15 March pay period. Retroactive IDT for drills on 17 & 18 February is input on 14 March. The SPO and reservist should expect the IDT pay to be delayed until the mid-month April pay cycle (15 April pay day). 

For payroll accounting purposes, Direct Access maintains Coast Guard Reserve pay via two separate and distinct calendars (Active and Reserve). In scenarios 2 & 3 above, the correct calendar must be built in order to retroactively correct the pay calendar for which the ADT/active duty was performed. SPOs and Reserve members must be made aware that retroactive approval of reserve activities will result in a lengthy delay in payment of Reserve member entitlements.

Review Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) Guidance

Published Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2015 11:30:01 CST



PPC continues to see SPOs entering in BAH rows erroneously which is causing severe pay errors. It is imperative that SPO users follow the Direct Access/Global Pay Knowledge guidance and ONLY enter in BAH row data after the user is confident they understand the sequence rules. When in doubt, ask the SPO YNC. If there are still questions, contact PPC for guidance.

System Not Allowing Timely CSP-Premium Starts

Published Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2015 10:30:01 CST




Due to a defect in the relationship between the pay calendars and edits on the start date for Career Sea Pay Premium (CSPP) the system is not allowing CSPP to start in some cases. 

When the system checks to see if the member has the necessary sea time it calculates against the current pay calendar not the start date in the transaction. For example, if a member has an eligibility date for CSPP on 2/6/2015, the earliest you can submit with the below dates is 2/15/2015 because the system can't read 3 years, 00 months, and 1 day until 2/15/2015. 


Calendar

Months

Days


15-FEB-15 3 0 12

Until this defect is repaired, SPOs may have to hold CSPP starts until the next pay calendar is in effect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prior Service Accession User Guides Updated

Published Date: Thu, 19 Feb 2015 15:30:01 CST



SPOs will no longer calculate the Pay Entry Base Date (PEBD) and Active Duty Base Date (ADBD) when completing accessions for personnel with prior service who have a break in service. This change is necessary to prevent longevity pay from being awarded to prior service personnel until completion of the SOCS.

The Rehire Prior Service and the Rehire Reserve user guides now reflect the procedural changes announced in E-Mail ALSPO B/15 (Policy and Procedures for Prior Service Accessions). 

The new process is for the SPO to enter the date the new period of service begins (the "rehire date") for the PEBD and ADBD and to immediately request a Statement of Creditable Service (SOCS) from PPC. 

PPC will complete the SOCS (provided all the documentation supporting the member's prior service claim is included in the request). Upon completion of the SOCS, service dates will be set by the PPC (ADV) Service Validation Team and members will then receive longevity pay and any longevity back pay due them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Home of Record Data Migration Issue

Published Date: Thu, 19 Feb 2015 15:30:01 CST



Many home of record entries were migrated from the previous version of DA with no street address. If you open one of these address rows you must enter a street address (Use "unknown" if the street address isn't available). If you exit without entering a street address the system will delete the entire home of record entry.

User Guides for IDT Multiple Drills Updated

Published Date: Wed, 18 Feb 2015 12:30:01 CST


The Self Service for Command and Servicing Personnel Office user guides for entering IDT Multiple Drills now reflect the change to the SPO Tree for pay approval. Also, the "load members" function now loads the entire unit and automatically checks the "Approved Checkbox". This eliminates the need to approve drills individually.

Solution for Missing IDT Drill Transactions

Published Date: Wed, 18 Feb 2015 12:30:01 CST


On 30 January 2015, DA 9.1 was updated requiring IDT drill routing to use the SPO Tree functionality. Many IDT drills submitted prior to 30 January 2015 were forwarded to specific EMPLIDs and are not viewable by SPO Auditors and remain unpaid. 

Programmers migrated a fix for this and identified all IDT drills with a status of "completed but not approved" and converted them to "scheduled and approved". Units should again change the status to "completed" and save them. Once saved, those IDT drills will be forwarded to the SPO Tree for approval.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit on Contract Term Preventing Some Extensions for Members Retained on Active Duty

Published Date: Wed, 18 Feb 2015 12:30:01 CST


Direct Access prevents saving of an extension if the total of all extensions exceed 72 months. 

However, if a member is involuntarily retained due to medical or otherwise, then the error should not occur. We've submitted a change request allow the extension to be saved and approved if the obligation type "RET" is selected (retention). 

Please contact PPC (Customer Care) if you encounter this error. PPC will have to intervene manually in these situations until the reprogramming is completed.

Additional Information and Procedures for New Payroll Processing Schedule

Published Date: Wed, 11 Feb 2015 15:30:01 CST


We recently announced a change to the Payroll Processing Schedule. We implemented a new "SPO Data Entry/Approval Cutoff", which is a few days before each "Payroll Finalized Date". 

The cutoff is for "Approvals" you can continue to work in DA between the cutoff and finalized dates. Just don't approve any transactions which require SPO Auditor approval, unless you are contacted by PPC (MAS) or (SEP) and requested to enter or approve a transaction to correct an error condition. You can start approving pay once finalize is completed.

Transaction to Start Discount Meal Rate Deduction Being Overlooked

Published Date: Tue, 10 Feb 2015 17:30:01 CST



When an enlisted member reports TDY or PCS to an Essential Unit Messing (EUM) or Essential Station Messing (ESM) unit, the SPO must start the Discount Meal Rate Deduction effective the day after reporting.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Special Characters in Address Fields

Published Date: Tue, 10 Feb 2015 16:30:01 CST

BAH-Transit Rate for Single Members Reporting From Accession Points and OHA Payable Areas

Published Date: Tue, 10 Feb 2015 16:30:01 CST


The Coast Guard Pay Manual, Figure 3-19 & Section 3.G.5, provides that BAH-Transit shall be paid to members without dependents in an enroute status when: 

(a) the member's old permanent duty station is an OHA (versus BAH) eligible locale; or 
 (b) the member is a non-prior service member in the accession pipeline. 

The Entering BAH-TR User Guide, contains the procedures for crediting BAH-Transit. The inclusive period of BAH-Transit eligibility is the date of departure PCS through the day prior to reporting PCS. For single members, it is the responsibility of the SPO for the member's new PDS (the Reporting SPO) to enter the transaction to record BAH-Transit.

BAH Transit Rate codes are:
•U - Mbr in Transit - With deps or paying child support; Mbr & deps not assigned govt qtrs
•V - Mbr in Transit - W/O deps or spouse in svc; no other deps and mbr not in govt qtrs

Do not use code "T" (With Deps; Based on child support; Mbr not assigned govt qtrs) or code "G" ( W/O dependents; Mbr not in govt qtrs) on transactions for BAH-Transit Rate.

The Pay Corrections Action Request

Published Date: Tue, 10 Feb 2015 16:30:01 CST


We've noticed a problem with the usage of the Pay Corrections Action Request. Users are incorrectly setting the Cancel field to "Yes" when attempting to correct a transaction. Setting this field to "Yes" will always result in the Pay Element being set to "Inactive" which will retroactively reverse all amounts paid or deducted in prior finalized calendars. 

The only time you choose "Yes" in the Cancel dropdown is if member was NEVER entitled to the pay element as it will cancel the pay element.

New User Guides Added for Starting Career Sea Pay

Published Date: Fri, 06 Feb 2015 16:30:01 CST


We've added two new user guides for Career Sea Pay. These new guides are in addition to the User Guide for Stopping Career Sea Pay due to terminal leave or TDY. 

Restarting Career Sea Pay after TDY file in pdf format

This guide provides the procedures for restarting Career Sea Pay after TDY for a member in Direct Access. For example, a member was on a Sea Pay eligible vessel and went TDY from 9/1/14-2/8/15. The SPO shut down the Career Sea Pay in 8.0 on 10/1/14 (his 31st day away from the vessel). The member returned to the ship on 2/9/15, so the Career Sea Pay must be restarted. The SPO must review the member's Sea Time Balances first, make the changes in the Career Sea Time Override and get the transaction approved. Once approved, PPC can review the member's sea time balances for accuracy. 

Starting Retroactive Career Sea Pay file in pdf format

This guide provides the procedures for starting retroactive Career Sea Pay for a member in Direct Access. For example, a member transferred to a Career Sea Pay unit on 8/22/14 and for whatever reason, the Sea Pay was never started. The SPO must review the member's Sea Time Balances first, make the changes in the Career Sea Time Override and get the transaction approved. Once approved, PPC can manually credit the member for the retroactive period. 

Note: Career Sea Pay should automatically start when a member reports to a Career Sea Pay eligible unit. This guide should only be used if the Sea Pay was not started before JUMPS was shut down.

Working with Grids and Tables

Published Date: Thu, 05 Feb 2015 16:30:01 CST


Many pages that contain lists of data are structured as sortable grids. Examples include the Airport Terminal and the "Dept Run" query. Data found in grids can be sorted in ascending or descending order. You can customize the sort order and show or hide columns. And, perhaps the most useful feature; you can export table or grid data to a spreadsheet format. 

Review the "Working with Grids and Tables" topic in the Knowledge Base to learn more about these features. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dept Run Fulfills Many of your Report Needs

Published Date: Thu, 05 Feb 2015 10:30:01 CST


The Dept (Department) Run query, which is located on a tab in the Airport Terminal, provides a wealth of information for personnel management. In addition to serving as unit roster, you can use it to:
•Find out when the last time a member had an employee review completed. 
•Produce a list of upcoming enlistment expiration dates. 
•Produce a list of personnel and their rotation dates. 
•And more!

Review the "Department Run" topic in the Knowledge Base to learn more about it.

Direct Access Data Transfer to DMDC/DEERS Delayed

Published Date: Wed, 04 Feb 2015 16:00:01 CST


The Coast Guard is experiencing difficulties updating the Defense Eligibility Enrollment Reporting System (DEERS). This is causing problems for members trying to obtain identification cards following an accession or reenlistment/extension of enlistment. 

This is the work around for ID cards while DEERS data is not being updated by Direct Access. 

If the member is already in DEERS, but needs data updated (i.e. due to reenlistment), the member needs to take a copy of the supporting document to the local DEERS site and they should be able to update it to issue an ID card. If the DEERS site cannot update the record or a new record needs to be entered in DEERS (i.e. an accession), the Site Security Manager (SSM) or Verifying Official (VO) at the DEERS site must contact Jacqueline Smith at the Coast Guard DEERS Project Office (via e-mail to ARL-PF-CGPSC-PSDFS-DEERS@uscg.mil or by telephone at 703-872-6642). All data MUST be in DA before any DEERS updates are made.

Officer Specialty Management System and YOU

Published Date: Wed, 04 Feb 2015 15:30:01 CST


Written by Cmdr. Beth Naff, CG-PSC-OPM-3 

Never heard of it? What is "OSMS"? The Officer Specialty Management System officially came online in June 2013. At its essence, this system provides the means to determine officer specialty demand (the billets) and supply (the officers) by way of assigned officer specialty codes. 

In general terms...what does the Coast Guard need and what do we have? 

The requirements of each officer specialty code are clearly defined by their respective programs. Each specialty is built on applicable competencies, training, education, certifications/licenses, and/or experience. This officer specialty clarity is especially useful to junior officers seeking career path guidance. 

"OSMS is critical to officer workforce management," Capt. Michael Johnston asserts from his position as Personnel Service Center - Officer Personnel Management, which manages the program. "The Coast Guard needs to know, with accuracy and completeness, what types of officer specialists do we need, and what do we have? This information feeds many human resource processes and decisions; including accession determination, workforce health management, the assignment process and training management, among others. Getting this information right is important to the Coast Guard, to the unit, and to you the member." 

How does this affect you

If you are an officer, you should work to obtain an officer specialty code/s assignment in your area of expertise. 

As leaders - educate, guide and support officers that work with and for you. 

Where to go from here:

Published Date: Wed, 04 Feb 2015 15:30:01 CST


ALCOAST 039/15 establishes Special Needs Program policy changes that will be incorporated into the next revision of Special Needs Program, COMDTINST 1754.7 (SERIES). The Special Needs Program case categorization is intended to address assignment coordination process for active duty (AD) members who are enrolled in the Special Needs Program. 

The new assignment process based on the categories of special needs shall be used for future assignments only. It shall not be retroactively applied to relocate personnel who are already assigned to duty stations.

Trouble Tickets for Retroactive Transactions

Published Date: Tue, 03 Feb 2015 16:30:01 CST


PPC is receiving a number of unnecessary trouble tickets from SPOs when they input transactions with start dates prior to 1 December 2014. Please read the "Trouble Tickets Unnecessary for Most Transactions Dated Prior to 01 December 2014" article we posted last week before submitting another trouble ticket for an out of range transaction.

Contacting PPC

Published Date: Tue, 03 Feb 2015 16:30:01 CST


Per ALCOAST 497/14, customers are directed to contact their P&A Office for any errors or questions on pay and/or personnel issues. If the P&A Office cannot resolve it, the P&A Office is to contact the servicing SPO. If the serving SPO cannot resolve the issues, the SPO will contact PPC. Customers should not be contacting PPC directly for any pay or personnel issues. We will continue to reroute inquiries directly from customers back to the serving SPO, AND contact the servicing SPO Chief to inform them that the ticket was rerouted.

Foreign Language Proficiency Pay (FLPP) Start Date

Published Date: Tue, 03 Feb 2015 16:30:01 CST


Foreign Language Proficiency Pay (FLPP) is a payable entitlement that requires annual recertification and a new entitlement action request for each year. 

As of 30JAN2015, any FLPP entitlement that began 1FEB2014 or greater for which the member is entitled to receive the payment would need to be entered into DA/GP to ensure proper payment to the member. Follow the procedure in the Starting FLPP user guide. For a member who remains continuously eligible for FLPP, the begin date would be the day following the end date of the FLPP entitlement as shown in the Element Assignment by Payee page for the member.

Please do not enter any back dated FLPP action requests in DA/GP for which the member already received payment as these transactions will produce an erroneous request for retroactive payments. This causes unnecessary work for PPC and delays processing of other active pay cases.

Airport Terminal Not Showing Orders for SPO Personnel

Published Date: Tue, 03 Feb 2015 16:30:01 CST


When using the Airport Terminal to view orders you must use the "Own Unit" relationship type to see orders for personnel attached to the SPO department ID. Use "HRS" to see all units serviced by the SPO. "HRS" will not show orders for the SPO ID entered because of the way the relationships were implemented in DA Ver. 9.1.

Contracts (Enlistment, Reenlistment, Extension, Re extension)

Published Date: Tue, 03 Feb 2015 16:30:01 CST


Edits while approval is pending:

This is an update on this issue. We've added a work around you can use to unlock transactions that have been modified while the status was "pending approval". 

Once you submit a transaction for approval, you must not make changes to that transaction unless you first "withdraw" the approval request, or the auditor has "denied" the request. This issue came up with contracts, where the approver receives an error when trying to approve a transaction that has been modified after routing ("Action Request is being Approved but corresponding contract record not found for update (30010,29). Please contact your system administrator."). However, it probably applies to everything else that is routed for approval. On contracts, you can check to see if a change has been made, after the initial submission date, by viewing the "Audit" tab. If you discover there has been a change, have the SPO Tech (who submitted the request) go into the contract and return anything that he or she changed back to the original value (the changes are listed on the audit tab), and save the page. This will unlock the action request and allow the SPO Auditor to deny it so it can be resubmitted with the corrections.

IDT Drills Changed to Use SPO Tree for SPO Approval

Published Date: Tue, 03 Feb 2015 14:30:01 CST


The procedures for approval of IDT drills have changed. In response to customer requests, CG-631 implemented use of the SPO Tree for routing drills from the command to the SPO for approval. In the initial implementation, the command needed to know the user ID of the person at the SPO who would be approving the drills. By using the SPO Tree, the drill approval will automatically routed to the SPO for the command submitting the drills. The drills will then be available to any of the SPO personnel for review and approval. 

The changes for command IDT approvers are minor. 

Here is the way the IDT drill approval looked prior to the change: 
the old approval process 
Notice the block for the for Approver ID. 

Here is the way IDT drill approval (for the command) looks now: 
the new approval process 

The Approver ID block has been removed. The command approver just needs to change the Drill Status to "Completed" (or other status as appropriate) and click the Save button. The drill transaction will be available to any of the authorized users attached to the SPO assigned to the command approver's unit (The SPO for the unit of the current logged in user, not the SPO for member the drills are for). The list of SPO-to-Unit relationships is available on our SPO Contact List web page. 

SPO Approval

SPOs will still access pending drills using the Approve Drills Action Request.

Increase to TRICARE Pharmacy Copays Begins February 1

Published Date: Mon, 02 Feb 2015 13:30:01 CST


New copayments for prescription drugs covered by TRICARE will go into effect February 1, 2015. The Fiscal Year 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requires TRICARE to increase most pharmacy copays by $3. Drugs from military pharmacies and generic drugs from TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery still cost beneficiaries $0. 

TRICARE pharmacy copays vary based on the class of drug and where beneficiaries choose to fill their prescriptions. Home Delivery copays for formulary brand name drugs are going from $13 to $16, and for non-formulary from $43 to $46. You can get up to a 90-day supply of drugs through Home Delivery. At the retail pharmacy network, copays for generic formulary drugs go from $5 to $8, brand name formulary go from $17 to $20 and non-formulary from $44 to $47. You can get up to a 30-day supply of drugs at retail pharmacies. 

Some pharmacy copays are not changing in 2015. Military pharmacies remain the lowest cost option for beneficiaries, with no cost for drugs, and generic formulary medications at Home Delivery remain $0. Home Delivery is a low cost, safe and convenient way for TRICARE beneficiaries to get their maintenance medications. Copays at non-network retail pharmacies will also change, based on the changes to retail copays. For more details, visit the TRICARE pharmacy costs page. 

These changes in the NDAA overrule previous rules passed by Congress in 2013 that connected TRICARE pharmacy copays to the retiree cost of living adjustment (COLA).

Personnel and Pay Procedures Manual - Update and Conversion to New Format

Published Date: Sat, 31 Jan 2015 15:30:01 CST


Live Update and Conversion to Tactics, Techniques, and procedures (TTP) Publication Format in Progress

We have updated two Chapters in the 3PM . The two chapters are: Personnel and Pay Systems Overview and Career Management. 

As we update the manual, we are converting it to TTP. TTP format requires a mandated Chapter 1, so all the chapter numbers will be changing. 

Major changes: 
•Replaced responsibility bullets for Admin Offices and SPO with the functional statements created by the SPO Realignment Working Group. 
•Contacting PPC - clarified that members are to coordinate resolution of pay and personnel issues through their P&A (Admin) Office who in turn will coordinate through their servicing SPO's. SPO's will coordinate/submit tickets to PPC. 
•Clarified that we will remove CGHRSUP role and PAO privileges if members do not complete required annual mandated training for PAO's. 
•Changed verbiage from "Certified To Be A True Copy" to "Certified Copy" (legal recommendation). Also clarified who can certify copies. 
•Shifted data entry responsibilities for education and test results, medals and awards, competencies and insignias to P&A (Admin) Offices.

We are working as quickly as possible to get the other chapters done.

Do Not Delay Approval of Separations

Published Date: Sat, 31 Jan 2015 14:30:01 CST


All separations can and should be approved as soon as all the information is completed on the separation orders (prior to or on the day of departing on terminal leave). 

DO NOT wait until the date of separation to approve a separation order. At a minimum, separations must be approved no later than two days prior to the SPO Data Entry/Approval Cutoff for the pay calendar for the member's separation date to allow time for processing. 

For example, if the member's separation date is 23 February 2015 (end-month February pay calendar), the separation must be approved on or before 14 February 2015, which is two days before the "SPO Data Entry/Approval Cutoff" for the end-month February pay day. 

Waiting until the separation date to approve the separation WILL cause overpayments to members. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Separations - Delay En Route and Leave Disposition Reminders

Published Date: Fri, 30 Jan 2015 13:30:01 CST


We are seeing separation orders (RELADs and discharges) with proceed time and travel time on them. RELADs and discharges are not authorized proceed time and travel time. When this information is entered, it is charged as leave and oftentimes puts members in a negative balance on leave, causing them to be in an overpaid status. 

Also, as a reminder, there is no "days leave to sell" block on the separation transaction. DA will automatically pay out for unused leave as part of the separation process. The leave carryover block is only used for Reserve Component members authorized to carry unused leave into inactive duty and for members changing components with no break in service (this does not include a regular member being released from active duty and transferred to the Coast Guard Reserve to fulfil their initial military service obligation).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Information and Procedures for New Payroll Processing Schedule

Published Date: Fri, 30 Jan 2015 13:30:01 CST


We recently announced a change to the Payroll Processing Schedule. We implemented a new "SPO Data Entry/Approval Cutoff", which is a few days before each "Payroll Finalized Date". 

The cutoff is for "Approvals" you can continue to work in DA between the cutoff and finalized dates. Just don't approve any transactions which require SPO Auditor approval. You can start approving pay once finalize is completed. 

Using this past pay cycle as an example. Jan 22 was finalize date. When you see the next pay calendar opened, that is the indicator that finalize has been completed. Here is path to the calendar: Active & Reserve Pay Shortcuts > Pay Calendar Results. Enter your EMPLID, using the same example, once you see "Calendar ID" CG ACT 2015M02M, you can start approving transactions.

Trouble Tickets Unnecessary for Most Transactions Dated Prior to 01 December 2014

Published Date: Fri, 30 Jan 2015 13:30:01 CST


There are only a few instances where you have to notify PPC that a transaction has been submitted with an effective date prior to 01 December 2014. Per E-Mail ALSPO G/14 (Direct Access/Global Pay Cutover Guidance), they are: 
•Clothing Allowance (Officer Uniform, Civilian, and Enlisted Supplemental) 
•COLA Unique 
•DMR Refund

In addition, we recently learned (and passed on to you on 27 January 2014) that Career Sea Pay Premium Action Requests dated prior to 01 December 2014 could not be entered. You must enter 01 December 2014 as the effective date, and notify PPC of the actual effective date. 

All other pay entitlement transactions with effective dates prior to 01 December 2014 appear on a report for PPC. Global Pay will credit/debit the member's pay from 1 December 2014 to present; manual credits/debits for periods prior to 1 December 2014 will be performed manually by PPC personnel. No trouble tickets are needed for these transactions.

Accessions Procedures - Pay Base Date for Prior Service Rehires 

Published Date: Thu, 29 Jan 2015 12:30:01 CST


The procedures for completing the accession of a member with prior service (active or reserve) have changed. 

Effective immediately, the SPO will use the date of accession as the pay base date (on the "Assigned Seniority Dates" panel) for members with prior service who have a break in service of more than 24 hours. PPC (ADV) will adjust the member's pay base date upon completion of a Statement of Creditable Service (SOCS). The SOCS process will also credit the member's pay with any back pay due. The SPO must submit a request for a SOCS anytime they complete an accession of a member with prior service who has a break in service of more than 24 hours. See the PPC (ADV) web page for SOCS request guidance. Interim Service Adjustments (as described in section 5-C of the Personnel and Pay Procedures Manual are no longer authorized at the SPO level. 

If completing the accession of a member with prior service who does not have a break in service, the SPO will carry the existing pay base date forward into the new accession.

State Tax Withholding Procedures Need Clarification

Published Date: Wed, 28 Jan 2015 17:30:01 CST


"READ THE GUIDES! We are getting numerous calls from folks that are not even opening the guides when trying to do transactions. Follow them step-by-step. Don't click, add, or delete anything unless the guides tell you to. You may inadvertently do more damage than good. Our procedure guides are continually being updated and created for those topics not already done. Be sure to use the most up-to-date guide by visiting the P&D web page." - CWO David Cota, Chief, PPC Customer Care Branch. 

Case in point - The process the Coast Guard uses to transfer data to the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) failed this month because a user didn't adhere to the step-by-step procedures in the State Tax Withholding User Guide and inserted a new row where there shouldn't have been one. A lot of time was expended by several personnel, in CG-631 and PPC, identifying the cause of the failure, correcting the data, and rerunning the process. 

We will update the User Guide to point out what not to do. However, it's already clear on what to do - "A new row must be added from the Federal Tax Data page in order to change the member's State Tax Data". No where does it say to insert a new row in State Tax Data. 

Remember, Direct Access is full of what I like to refer to as "Stupid PeopleSoft Tricks". There are plenty of places where it looks like you should delete or insert something or change a value from "active" to "inactive". If the system was that user-friendly, you wouldn't need guides at all. And I and my work mates wouldn't have jobs. Read the guides! You don't want us to be unemployed do you?

Calendar Year 2015 Payroll Processing Schedule Revision

Published Date: Wed, 28 Jan 2015 14:30:01 CST


The Payroll Processing Schedule has been revised to allow PPC and SPOs time to review data entry and make any necessary corrections prior to finalizing the payroll for transmission to the Treasury.

For the SPO, the right column of the schedule - SPO Data Entry/Approval Cutoff, is very important to understand. The SPO Data Entry/Approval Cutoff is imperative to allow PPC to identify and correct critical errors prior to the Payroll Finalized date. During the period between SPO Data Entry/Approval Cutoff and the Payroll Finalized date, if necessary, PPC will contact a SPO directing immediate corrective action to resolve critical errors. These PPC directed transactions are the ONLY SPO data approvals authorized during this period. 

Note: SPO's CAN continue to enter pay transaction requests after the cut, BUT the auditor CANNOT approve any transactions, as these approved transactions change the pay data PPC (MAS) is trying to validate. 

Due to system limitations, we cannot physically lock down DA to prevent SPO Auditors from approving transactions passed the SPO Data Entry/Approval Cutoff date, but it is in the best interest of all SPO's to adhere to the calendar as any SPO data approval after that cutoff could negatively impact a member's pay. PPC will be monitoring the system and will contact a SPO's leadership to report violations. 

Upon completion of the Payroll Finalization process, the next pay calendar will populate and SPO's can resume data entry and approvals for that next pay calendar. 

Example: The "SPO Data Entry/Approval Cutoff" for the 13 February payday is 5 February (2400 Hrs. (CST)). The "Payroll finalized Date" is 10 February (no time is given; let's assume 0001 Hrs. (CST)). In accordance with the new process, you (the SPO Auditor) must not approve any transactions on 6, 7, 8, or 9 February, unless you are contacted by PPC and requested to correct an entry or create an entry.

Career Sea Pay Premium Payroll Action Request

Published Date: Tue, 27 Jan 2015 13:30:01 CST


Here is an update to the information we passed yesterday about an issue with the Career Sea Pay Premium Payroll Action Request. Users are receiving an error that the member has ZERO sea time even though the sea time page reflected the proper time. The issue is limited to transactions with a start date prior to 1 December 2014. It is not a defect. It is a result of the cutover to the new system. Direct Access was only populated with payroll data from 1 December 2014 forward. Many other transactions are able to accept effective dates prior to 1 December 2014, the system computes pay from 1 December and any retroactive amount due is paid by PPC (MAS) using an out of range report. The CSPP Payroll Action Request is not one of them. Here is the workaround for this issue:

When starting Careers Sea Pay Premium (CSPP) with an effective date prior to 1 December 2014, the SPO must enter 1 December 2014 as the effective date, save, and approve the transaction. Then, notify PPC (MAS), via Customer Care Trouble Ticket that the member is due CSPP from the actual effective date to 30 November 2014. PPC (MAS) will review the case and issue a payment via One Time Positive Input (OTPI) to credit the member with back pay. 

The Career Sea Pay Premium Start Date Calculator is available on our web site (http://www.uscg.mil/ppc/mas.asp#cspp) to help you determine the correct date to start CSPP.

Career Sea Pay Premium Payroll Action Request

Published Date: Mon, 26 Jan 2015 17:00:01 CST


Resolved 1/27/2015 12:43PM: If the start date is prior to 1 December 2014, enter 1 December 2014 as the start date. This will allow you to save and have the request approved. Once approved, notify PPC (MAS) via a Customer Care trouble ticket. Provide the member's identifying information and the actual effective date to start the entitlement. PPC will build a pay case and issue payment for the retroactive amount due. 

An issue has been reported with the Career Sea Pay Premium Payroll Action Request. 

When an SPO attempts to enter Career Sea Pay Premium on a member, GP may state that member has ZERO sea time even though the sea time page is reflecting the proper time. This has been reported as a defect. Once the defect is resolved, the SPOs will be able to enter the entitlement and if out of range, the transaction will populate on PPC's retro report and PPC will work the pay case.

Issues with Contracts (Enlistment, Reenlistment, Extension, Re extension) in DA

Published Date: Mon, 26 Jan 2015 17:00:01 CST

•
Edits while approval pends: Once you submit a transaction for approval, you must not make changes to that transaction unless you first "withdraw" the approval request, or the auditor has "denied" the request.

. 
This issue came up with contracts, where the approver receives an error when trying to approve a transaction that has been modified after routing ("Action Request is being Approved but corresponding contract record not found for update (30010,29). Please contact your system administrator."). However, it probably applies to everything else that is routed for approval. On contracts, you can check to see if a change has been made, after the initial submission date, by viewing the "Audit" tab. 
•
Commissioning Contracts: It has been reported that contracts for commissioned officers only accept whole years, not days, months, and years. This create an issue for the SPO when completing a contract for an officer who will not be able to complete 30 years of commissioned service prior to their 60th birthday. Current procedures call for the contract termination date to be entered as "Date of 30 years commissioned service or the date of first day of the month following officer's 60th birthday whichever is first". To get around this limitation, enter the termination date as 30 years from the date of appointment AND notify PPC (ADV), via Customer Care Trouble Ticket, that the officer's Expected Active Duty Termination date and Expected Loss date need to be manually adjusted to reflect "the date of first day of the month following officer's 60th birthday".

Thinking about a tax refund anticipation loan? DoD regulation limits interest rates for military, families

Published Date: Mon, 26 Jan 2014 13:30:16 CST


Most of us have heard the horror stories of payday loan offices and used car lots charging military members interest rates that are through the roof. Some service members find it difficult to get out of a cycle of debt that grows faster than they can repay. 

DoD was tasked by law (National Defense Authorization Action for Fiscal Year 2007) to draft a Predatory Lending regulation which protects service members and their families from unscrupulous loan products. The regulation was written and enforcement began on October 1, 2007, and sets the max interest rate allowed is 36 percent. 

Military members and families are often targeted by payday lenders. Payday loans are short-term cash loans based on the borrower's personal check held for future deposit or electronic access to the borrower's bank account. Borrowers write a personal check for the amount borrowed plus the finance charge and receive cash. In some cases, borrowers sign over electronic access to their bank accounts to receive and repay payday loans. Lenders hold the checks until the next payday when loans and the finance charge must be paid in one lump sum. To pay a loan, borrowers can redeem the check for cash, allow the check to be deposited at the bank, or just pay the finance charge to roll the loan over for another pay period. 

Since October 2007, the Federal regulation has prohibited creditors from making payday loans, vehicle title loans and tax refund anticipation loans to active duty service members and their dependents with annual percentage rates over 36 percent. Knowing the rules can help military members understand their rights, and to report violators to their Coast Guard Legal Assistance office.

Free tax-filing service offered through CGSUPRT

Published Date: Wed, 26 Jan 2015 10:30:16 CST


The Internal Revenue Service 2015 tax season begins on Jan. 20. Starting Jan. 13, CGSUPRT will offer free 2014 tax return filing services from H&R Block. This free offer is only valid if you access H&R Block through the link on the CGSUPRT website. 

Summary

You must start your return from the CG SUPRT H&R Block Tax Software link to access this free offer. 

The IRS will begin processing efile returns on January 20, 2014. If you complete your returns with the H&R Block Tax Software service offered through CG SUPRT prior to the 20th of January, your files will be held in a pending status. Once efile opens, the system automatically submits the return to the IRS. 

This is the same free tax preparation program you may have used in past years. So, if you created an H&R Block account last year, your login credentials for that account will still work and you will be able to access last year's personal tax information. 

For technical assistance with the H&R Block Tax Software tool, please call 1-800-HRBLOCK (472-5625). 

To learn more about the H&R Block Tax service, please see the FAQs. 

If you have questions about this tax service or about your own tax returns, please call 855-CG SUPRT (247-8778) and ask to schedule an appointment with a CG SUPRT tax consultant. Trained tax consultants are available 5 days a week (Monday - Friday) from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., EST by appointment. 

Best practices for filing your taxes
•Have all of your documents and information ready when preparing your taxes-Social Security number, TIN's, W-2's, 1099 forms, expense documents, bank account information in case of refund, etc. 
•Be sure to disclose all of your income from the year-including wages, investments, etc. 
•Determine the best way to file for yourself-prepare your taxes online, paper file, or take them to a preparer. 
•File early-it's best to do it once you receive all of your documents, reducing the risk of misplacing them, reducing the wait time of receiving a refund, and/or avoiding penalties for late filing. 
•Know the deadline for filing your taxes-it is not always the same date every year. This year it is Wednesday, April 15, 2015. 

Eligibility
The following are eligible for the CG SUPRT tax service: •All Active-duty and selected reserve members of the U.S. Coast Guard. 
•Spouses and dependent children of the services noted above, and who are authorized in DEERS. 
•All civilian employees (GS) of the U.S. Coast Guard 
•Household members and dependents of U.S. Coast Guard civilian employees.
