SMALL-SCALE SOLAR-POWERED PUMPING SYSTEMS
TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC REVIEW
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report reviews the use of small-scale solar powered pumping systems for the irrigation
of crops in small land-holdings in developing countries (i.e. of the order of 1 ha).
The introductory chapter places this Review in the context of the wider UNDP funded
project GL0/78j004, which also involved practical testing of systems.
This is followed by a discussion of the principal prime-mover power options available for
smali-scale irrigation pumping and how they compare, followed by general discussion of
the appropriate sizing of systems, engineering requirements (to suit the operational environment)
and the importance of local manufacture of systems within developing countries.
The main body of this Review then consists of a technical assessment and appraisal of the
principal types of solar pumping system available and the apparent merits and demerits of
numerious subsystem and component choices. A brief historical outline of the development
of these technologies is included, with information on currently operational systems and
.some assessmentso f possible future trends. This technical assessmenta nd appraisal is subdivided
broadly into three sections. dealing with (i) photovoltaic, (ii) thermal and (iii) unconventional
systems that may have a future role.
Finally. there is a brief section which attempts to compare the relative eftkiencies and
hence the relative costs of the subsystems that comprise the principal small-scale solar
pumping system options that we currently available. This section is necessarily speculative,
being based on the very tentative cost data associated with today’s immature technology
in this field, but it does indicate that it should be possible to achieve acceptably low capital
costs for future systems once technical maturity and full scale production are achieved.
I
1 XNTRODUCTION
1.1 Background to Review
The direct use of solar power may in future find widespread application by farmers
in developing countries for the small-scale pumping of irrigation water. The
technical feasibility of solar powered pumping has been demonstrated using several
different methods of energy conversion, but up to the present it has generally
appeared that the technology is too expensive ro be economically viable when
compared with conventional alternatives, such as diesel or mains electric pumps.
Furthermore, the equipment is often not sufficiently simple and robust to be
appropriate for use and upkeep by farmers in developing countries nor has it
yet been developed to the stage of being a mature product. With few exceptions,
ail the solar pumping equipment available at present is of prototype status,
few models having been manufactured in any quantity.
The present Project has been specifically restricted to the testing and demonstration
of small-sca!e solar-powered pumping systems capable of providing a flow of
not less than one litre per second, primarily for irrigation purposes. To be economically
attractive, the World Bank/UNDP considered that the pumping systems
would ultimately need to deliver water at a cost not exceeding US 8 0.05 per
cubic metre (I 979 prices). As the power requirement and hence the unit cost of
water pumped increases in direct proportion to the total head against which the
water is pumped (for a given flow), a point must obviously be reached at which it
becomes uneconomic to pump through greater heads. The combination of head
and flow at which pumping becomes uneconomic is site specitic and depends on
costs of the pump and maintenance, crop water requirement and the extra income
expected to accrue from improved irrigation. No universally applicable value for
this limiting head can be cited, but it is almost certain to be less than 1 Om.
It was the informal but considered judgement of irrigation advisers to the World
Bank and othea that for the purposes of this Project attention should be concentrated
on pumps in the hydraulic power output* range of 100 to 500 watts,
although systems up to 2000 watts should not be excluded. Considerably larger
power outputs are technically possible, but the size ra;rrl?ion adopted for this
Project is appropriate to the needs of many millions of family farms and small
holdings in the developing world. In particular, the small-scale approach keeps the
capital cost down and avoids the problems of multiple uses, with the associated
costs of water distribution and control.
The importance of the small-scale approach is fully discussed in the Project Report
and in this Review, and endorsed by many other references, (e.g. Ref. 2).
1.2 UNDPjWorld Bank Project
As stated in the Project Document signed by the World Bank and UNDP in June
1978, this Project forms part of an overall search to develop small-scale pumping
systems for water supply and irrigation applications in developing countries which:
* ‘hydraulic power output’ means pumped water output calculated on the basis of
the product of flow and tofal (pumped head).
2
are based on renewable energy sources;
are decentralized;
C) have costs low enough for small farmers;
d) have minimal and simple operation and maintenance requirements; and
e) have good prospects for local manufacture and/or assembly.
The UNDP and World Bank decided that the work should first concentrate on the
use of solar energy and investigate its application to irrigation pumping. The first
phase of the Project was mounted with the overall objective of advising the UNDP
and World Bank on whether solar pumping technology was in a position such that
it would be worth promoting its development to make it appropriate for pumping
water under the conditions that prevail on small farms in the developing world and,
if so, what steps should be taken. The enquiry was thus open, although it was
expected that the potential of the technology would be recognised and that further
dtrelopment would be recommended.
The main activities in Phase I included field trials of possible systems, laboratory
tests on principal components and system design studies. In undertaking this work
the importance of the potential manufacture (or at least assembly) of systems in
developing countries themselves was recognised.
At a very early stage in project preparation (before the Consultants were involved)
discussions were held under UNDP auspices to decide on the locations of the field
trials. Agreement was reached in principle for the participation of India, Mali,
Philippines and Sudan but in the event India did not participate in the field trials
which were, therefore, hosted by and carried out in Mali, Philippines and Sudan.
1.3 Context of Review
This Review is submitted to the World Bank at the conclusion of the Phase I of
a UNDP Project to test and demonstrate small-scale solar pumps.
During this Phase, which commenced in July 1979 and ran until May 1981, the
Consultants completed an initial State-of-Art Report (Ref. 1) in December 1979;
this Review is intended to supersede the earlier Report and therefore repeats many
sections from it.
Subsequently, after gaining the approval of the World Bank for their recommendations,
the Consultants purchased a selection of the more credible photovoltaic
and thermal small-scale solar-pumping systems available in early 1980 for field
testing in Mali, Philippines and Sudan, in collaboration with the energy research
agencies in those countries. Four systems were tested in each country; of these
eleven were photovoltaic (PV) powered and one was thermal.
Samples of the motors and pumps used in the field-tested photovoltaic systems
were subjected to a parallel programme of laboratory testing in the UK, principaily
to determine their performance characteristics. Sample PV modules from their
arrays were performance tested in the UK and in the USA by independent testing
authorities and the modules were subsequently subjected to intensive environmental
testing in the USA.
3
Finally, the data produced from these test programmes were utilised in computerbased
mathematical models of PV and thermal small-scale pumping systems. The
purpose of the modelling exercise was to allow the rapid evaluation of the relative
merits of the many different system options that are possible in making up a solar
pump, as part of a design study aimed at identifying the most promising technical
approaches to pump design for low head irrigation appUcations.
Since the ultimate criterion for “goodness” of a solar pump is the actual cost of
the useful pumped output it produces over its lifetime, an attempt was made to
introduce the relative costs of different system components and subsystems into
the modelling process and a parameter to assess cost-effectiveness was adopted.
This Revievi necessarily draws on the general conclusions reached in Phase I of the
Project and for the convenience of readem the Executive Summary of the Project
Report is included in the Review as Appendix 3.
It is hoped that the Report and Review together will provide guidance to governments
and agencies about the performance and cost-effectiveness of many solar
pumps and the desirable features which they should possess.
1.4 Scope of Review
This Review disccsses tte general technical and power requirements for smallscale
irrigation and reports on a study of system economics, reviewing the effects
of variation in the major influences on solar pumping and the differential movement
in prices. The principal photovoltaic and thermal prime-mover power options
available for small-scale irrigation pumping and the engineering requirements for
this type of system are described. A technical assessment is made of the main
types of solar pumping system avaiiable and information is given on possible
future trends. The Review concludes with a comparison of the relative efficiencies
and costs of the main system options which are currently available and with an
estimate of the costs for which it may be possible to produce these systems in
the future.

2 ROLE OF SMALL-SCALE SOLAR PUMPING FOR IRRIGATION
2.1 The Incretig Importance of Irrigation
As the end of this century is approached, feeding the worlds population (which
is expected to increase by SO% by the year 2000) will prove an increasingly difficult
and challenging problem, and nowhere more so than in the poorer, less fertile
or densely populated regions of the developing countries.
Irrigation is widely perceived as one of the key components in improving food
production; there is no readily identifiable yield-increasing technology other than
the improved seed-water-fertilizer approach. Further, it is expected that in the next
two decades about three quarters of all the increases in the output of basic staples
will have to come from yield increases, even though during the past decade yield
increases have only supplied half the increase in output, (Ref.3). This is largely
because there is less and less uncultivated, but fertile, land available in the more
densely populated regions; hence irrigation will be important not only to increase
the yield from existing cultivated land, but also to permit the cultivation of what
are today marginal or unusable areas of land.
Table 1 indicates the irrigated areas in the world (Ref.4), together with the
principal developing countries where irrigation is practised. The majority of the
land brought under irrigation since 1972 is mainly in countries where irrigation has
traditionally been practised.
It is apparent from thin Table that only a limited number of countries have
significant areas of land under irrigation, and that two of the largest countries in
Asia, China and India, account for half the world’s irrigated land. It is also
interesting to note that nearly half the irrigated land in the whole African
continent lies in the Nile delta region of Egypt.
These relatively densely populated, intensively cultivated regions almost certainly
practise today what many other regions, with increasing population pressures on
the land, will have to practise in the future, if sufficient food production is to be
assured. Fanning in Asia today is perhaps the most realistic model of the kind of
farming that will need to be prac”?*d in Africa and Latin America tomorrow.
2.2 The “Energy Crisis” and Irrigation
A large proportion of the world’s traditionally irrigated land is commanded by
gravity-fed water obtained by controlling the flow of rivers and providing suitable
canal distribution systems. This is evidently a desirable method since there
are little or no energy costs associated with distributing the water once the scheme
has been completed. However, there are limits to the amount of land that can
readily be commanded by gravity-fed water, and many populations and the land
they require to cultivate cannot benefit from such schemes, now or in the future.

TAME 1 - IRRlGATED AREAS OF TRE WORLD IN 1972
6
During the 1950s and 6Os, the cost of petroleum-based energy tended to fall in
real terms, which encouraged the increasing use of engine-driven irrigation pumps
(and also the spread of rural electrification, and hence electrically energised irrigation
pumps). In fact the area of irrigated land in the world has been estimated
(Ref.4) as having increased by about 70% in the period from 1952 to 1972, and
much of this will have been through engine or electric-motor driven pumping.
Although mechanised irrigation continued during the 1970s since 1973 the great
increases in real terms of petroleum costs (and hence electricity costs) have reduced
tbs mar&in to be gained by farmers from irrigation, because food prices cannot and
have no: been allowed to increase in line with energy costs.
The high cost of oil, in addition to putting an increasing burden on those farmers
who already practise mechanised irrigation, severely discourages farmers fro.n
bringing new land under irrigation. A further problem ln recent years has been the
availability of diesel fuel. Supplies of fuel in many countries and particularly
in remoter and poorer regions have become increasingly unreliable even for those
with the resources to purchase them. This is a further inhibiting factor which
worries many farmers who often depend on a supply of fuel to prevent the total
loss of a crop.
Some governments attempt to mitigate the situation by subsidising oil and rural
electricity for use in agriculture, but many of these governments are the very ones
that can least afford such a policy which incum balance of payments deficits,
largely because of the increasing cost of oil imports. There is a pressing need
therefore in many developing countries to discourage the increased use of oil even
though there is an equally pressing need to increase food production, and mechanised
irrigation is a widely recognised means to do this.
Thus, it is becoming most important to find new methods for energising irrigation
pumps that are independent of oil or centralised rural electricity. The latter is
almost always generated from oil and the poor power factors, high infrastructural
costs and peaky demands make it an unpromising source of energy for large, poor,
rural communities.
2.3 SmalI-Scale irrigation
Small-scale irrigation (sometimes known as micro-irrigation) is certain to become
an increasingly important and widely used agricultural technique during the next
few decades, particularly in developing countries. This is because the majority of
land holdings in the poorer, more densely populated parts of the world are small,
often a hectare or less. Studies have shown that these numerous and small land
holdings are in fact more productive than larger farming units. An Indian farm
management study (Ref. S), indicated that small family-run land-holdings are
consistently more productive than larger farm units in yield per hectare, although
the small units are more demanding in terms of labour inputs. A survey conducted
in Brazil (Ref. 5) also illustrated the better iand utilisation of small farms, but
family-sized land holdings only achieved this through applying 5 to 22 times as
much labour per hectare as large farms.
7
SmalI land holdings also generally achieve better energy ratios (i.e. energy value
hi the food product/energy inputs to produce it) in their crop production than
is achieved by large-scale mechanised agriculture. This is discussed in detail in
Ref.6 which indicated that typical energy ratios for tropical subsistence and semisubsistence
agriculture arc in the range 10 to 60, while mechanised large-scale
commercial agriculture generally has energy ratios of from 4 to less then unity.
Hence, in a world ‘,, .th diminishing availability of commercial fuels, there appears
more scope for signiticantly increasing food production through encouraging
labour-intensive small-scale units which are likely to produce more fmm a given
land and energy investment.
Investment in inigation also has a positive effect in terms of alleviating poverty; for
example, irrigation schemes can double the amount of labour required per hectare
of land (Ref.5) and raise the incomes of landless labourem, even though the farmers
of course derive the greatest benefit. The same reference gave details of surveys of
average percentage increases in household income for farmers prac?ising irrigation,
compared with those who do not. The increases obtained were 469% in Cameroon,
95% in South Korea, 90% in Malaysia, and 98% in Uttar Pradesh State, India. !n
the Malaysian case, the benefit, on average, accruing from irrigation to landless
labourers was 127%.
The Asian Development Bank is assisting in the improvement of 12,000 sq.km of
land through irrigation schemes, which are expected to benefit 5.1 million people
and create 400,000 man years of work. When the potential of these current
projects is reamed, they are expected to craate an annual increase of 3.2 million
tonnes of unmilled rice: the per capita income for families which benefit directly is
expected to increase from 92 to 227 US dollars, nearly 150% (Ref. 7).
The scope for gaming improved yields through small-scaIe irrigation is substantial;
for example the average rice yield in South and South East Asia is about 2t/ha,
while in Japan, with sophisticated small-scale irrigation and land-management,
yields are typically 6t/ha (Ref.7). The Asian Development Bank has reported
that a doubting of rice production per hectare should be possible in the region
within 15 years (Ref.7) and is considering a programme with this target. 304,000
sq. km of rainfed and 175,000 sq. km of inadequately irrigated~ land is to be
converted to adequately irrigated land through an investment of 540,000 million
US dollars (1975 prices), which is an average investment of about 11,000 US
dollars per improved hectare (Ref.7).
2.4 Power Requirements for Irrigation
The minimum power requirement, (P), to lift irrigation water is directly
proportional to the product of the total state head (H), (or height through which
the water must be lifted from its source in order to flow onto the fields, plus pipe
friction energy and other energy losses), and the flow rate of the water at any given
moment (Q).
i.e. P = k.H.Q (where k is a constant)
Generally, for economy, the system will be designed so that the static head will
comprise a large proportion of the total head, so that losses arc kept reasonably
small. The cost of pumping water is closely related to the rate of power usage (i.e.
the energy requirement in a given time period). Hence the higher the static head or
the larger the quantity of water to be pumped, the greater the resulting costs.
a
The static head is a Rutction of the vertical distance from the surface of the water
source to the surface of the field. However, higher heads and consequently more
power for a given flow rate are normally needed in order to distribute the water
from the pumping system delivery pipe to the plants. The simplest method is
for the water to be distributed by gravity, which means that it has to be pumped to
an elevation high enough for it to flow effectively across the land area to be irrigated.
The outlet for a gravity distributed irrigation system may need to be typically
Im above ground level; while this is low in absolute terms, for low lift irrigation
from a source say only 3m below ground level, this extra metre of head requires
33% more energy (and similar associated costs) to move a given quantity of water.
Pumping water through distribution pipes also implies adding to the effective head,
due to friction in the pipes. The use of pipes of too small a diameter can have a
profound effect on the energy requirements (and consequent costs) of low head
pumping systems. Sprinkler irrigation and most drip feed irrigation systems,
although economising effectively in the water quantities needed, generally require
quite high operating pressures, and are therefore expensive in terms of energy
requirement at low static heads.
So the effective head through which water must be pumped depends on the total
static head, the losses in the pipework linking the pump to the source and delivery
point, and on the additional head necessary for the water distribution system.
The quantity of water needed to irrigate a given land area depends on a number of
factors, the most important being:
1. nature of crop
2. crop growth cycle periods
3. climatic conditions
4. type and condition of soil
5. land topography
6. field application efficiency
7. conveyence efficiency
a. water quality
Many of these vary with the seasons and the quantity of water required is far from
constant. The design of a small irrigation pump installation will need to take all
these factors into account and include consideration of the economics of providing
storage.
The estimation of overall irrigation water requirements starts with the water
requirement of the crop itself. Calculation begins with a standarised criterion
known as the ‘reference crop evapotranspiration” (ET,:: this is the rate of evapotranspiration
from an extended surface of actively growing tall green grass
completely shading the ground and not short of water. It depends on temperature,
humidity, wind and cloud cover (or sunshine hours). ET, is the water demand of
the reference crop itself and if water is available from no other source represents
the quality which has to be supplied by irrigation. ET, can be computed by a
number of internationally accepted methods using standard meteorological data
(e.g. Ref 38) or estimated from pan evaporation data. Since ET, depends on
climatic factors it varies from month to month, sometimes by a factor of 2.
9
The evapotranspiration of a particular crop (ETcrop) is of course different from
that of the reference crop and is determined from the equation.
ETmop = ET, x K,
Kc is a “crop coefficient” which varies with the type of crop, stage of growth,
growing season and prevailing weather. It commonly varies from about 0.3 during
initial growth to as much as 1 .O during the mid-season growth peiiod. Thus the
actual crop water requirement ETcrop can (& does) vary quite considerably during
the growing season.
The nett irrigation requirement over a specified time period is the depth of water
required to meet the crop evapotranspiration demand, less any contributions from
rainfall, groundwater or stored soil water. (Some rainfall is lost to the crop by
surface runoff, deep percolation and evaporation and the rainfall is factored to
obtain the ‘effective rainfall’ available for crop use). Allowance also has to be made
for the water needed for preparation of the land - this can be significant,
particularly in the case of rice. The nett irrigation requirement then has to be
increased to alIow for losses which occur during conveyance and application in the
field to obtain the gross irrigation requirement.
Table 2, adapted from Ref. 8, illustrates typical irrigation water requirements for
cotton and wheat in the vicinity of Lake Chad in central West Africa. The
estimated availability of solar energy, on average, for the various months is also
given. The Table illustrates a typical irrigation pattern to be expected in a semiarid
tropical region and shows clearly how the actual irrigation demand varies
substantially with the growing seasons. The Table also shows that if solar energy
is to be used to power a pump, the sunniest months do not necessarily coincide
with the months of maximum demand. The same information is presented
graphically in Figure 1,
A constant field application efficiency of 60% is assumed in Table 2: this is the
proportion .of water applied to the field which actually contributes to the nett
irrigation requirement and is a function of the method of water distribution
and of the farmer’s water management abilities. Surface (flood) irrigation is
typically 30 to 60% efiicient, while sprinkler irrigation systems can be 60 to 80%
efticient. Certain new systems of irrigation, such as trickle or drip irrigation or
under-soil irrigation can be better than 80% efficient.
Typic& figures for other crops and regions are in the range from about 4,000 cu.
m./ha per crop (using an efficient distribution system and good water management)
to as much as 13,000 cu.m./ha per crop in the Sahel dry season, i.e. 400 to
1300mm of water per crop. (Refs. 2, 8, 9, etc.). Typical growing cycles are of the
order of 120 days under tropical conditions; the average daily requirement is thus
in the range 35 to 100 cu.m./ha. Assuming an average of 8 hours pumping per day
is possible (as would apply with solar pumps without any energy storage), then the
average flow required is in the range 1.2 to as much as 3.5 litres/sec per hectare.
For solar pumps, the flow under peak sunlight conditions (of around lOOOW/sq.m)
is likely to be about 25% above the average, so peak flows in the range 1.5 to 4.3
litre/sec are likely to be needed for solar-powered irrigation systems to service one
hectare of land.

Assuming, for example, a water-table Sm below the pump discharge level and
distribution thereafter by gravity, then the peak hydraulic power output
corresponding to the range of flow rates given above will be 73 to 210 W/ha.
Slightly different numerical assumptions can yield hydraulic powers of up to
3OClW/ha, for a Sm lift. Input power requirements will be considerably higher
depending on the system efficiency, as will be discussed in more detail later.
Power requirements are directly proportional to the actual head across the pump.
This consists largely of the static head through which the water is lifted, but also
includes the pipe friction and associated energy losses. The friction head can be a
significant proportion of the total head, particularly with low head systems of 5m
‘or less or with systems having a significant length of delivery pipe. The velocity
head is normally small unless water distribution is by spraying. Hence it is
important to take the head losses in the pipework into account as part of the
system design.
Since water for irrigation has a ftite value, related principally to the marginal value
of the extra crops gained, and the cost of water increases with increases in head, it
becomes decreasingly profitable to irrigate as the pumping head increases. There
will be a certain static head above which it will be uneconomic to irrigate, as the
costs will exceed the benefits.
Similarly, transmitting the water long disrances will increase the power requirements
because of the extra energy required to overcome pipe friction*. If pipe
friction is avoided by distributing the water through channels by gravity, extra
head has to be provided to obtain a sufficient hydraulic gradient in the channel.
Also, in the latter case, evaporation loues will increase in relation to the surface
area of water in the channels and unless the channels are totally impervious (i.e.
concrete, steel or plastic), losses due to seepage are also possible, all incurring a
power demand.
It follows from this that the losses (either by leakage and evaparation, or by an
effectively increased pumping head) will increase in relation to the area of land to
be commanded by the pumping system, and any economies of scale obtained by
using a larger pumping system will be countered by extra costs of distribution.
From the foregoing description, it will be appreciated that careful system design
is necessary if solar pumps are to be used effectively in irrigation applications.
2.5 Pumping Methods Available
2.5.1 General
The principal traditional methods for lifting irrigation water itI the tropics
have been (and in many areas still are):
1. human labour, (e.g. using a Shaduf water crane)
2. draught animals, (e.g. “sing a Persian Wheel or Noria)
* The head loss in the pipework due to friction is a function of the resistance
coefficient, the size of the flow rate, the iength of pipe and the inverse of the
fifth power of the pipe diameter. The resistance coefficent is related to
Reynolds number and the relative roughness of the pipe surface.

12. solar radiation, directly converted (which is the subject of this
Review)
The main advantages and disadvantages of these methods are outlined
briefly in Table 3.
2.5.2 Solar Pumping Options
There have been a number of books and papers published recently which
include reviews of the present state of the technology of solar-powered
pumping (see for example References 16 to 24 inclusive). The information
given in these publications has been supplemented and updated by the
extensive enquiries to manufacturers and research institutions made under
this Project with a view to purchasing equipment for testing under Phase
1.
The most feasible options for solar-powered pumping systems for the
power range under consideration, with the present state of development
of solar power technology, are illustrated schematically in Figure 2.
At present, none of these alternative systems has a clear overall advantage
although sane options appear to be better than others. Their various
advantages and disadvantages are discussed in detail in later chapters.
Examples of all of these systems (with almost ewry permutation of engine
and transmission illustrated) are cr;i+ently being developed but few are
commercially available; the majority of those on the market consist of
Fixed photovoltaic flatplate arrays powering a d.c. electric motor/pump
unit. The systems and components which are commercially available
today are reported on separately in the Project Report.
In addition to the main options for solar pumping referred to above, a
number of further technical options which may possibly have a future role
are reviewed in Chapter 6.

2.6 The Suitability of Solar Pumps for Irrigation
The main advantage of using direct solar radiation as a power source for irrigation
pumping is that it is the only energy resource that is almost universally available
both when and where it is needed. Most of the countries where irrigation is necessary
have high levels of solar irradiation and the availa5lity of sunlight does COP
relate at least partialiy with the crop water demand.
The correlation is often not perfect, in the sense that the time of the year when
most solar energy is available often does not exactly coincide with periods of
maximum irrigation water demand, (this is illustrated by the example in Table
2 and by Figure 1 derived from it). However, the period of least availability of
solar energy is normally coincident with the period of least or zero irrigation water
demand, being invariably the rainy season.
A solar pump, once installed, is clearly independent of fuel supplies or other
external constraints and, in effect, runs on the same energy resource a%th e plants
it serves to water. However, most of the lifetime cost of a solar pump has to be met
at the time of purchase, since the main cost element is inherent in the first cost,
operating and maintenance costs being very low for a successful solar pumping
system design. The provision of finance to assist the poorer farmers to meet this
fit cost is an important aspect of the transfer of this technology that will have to
be addressed once it is clear that solar pumps provide genuinely economic means of
raising water. Government backed agricultwal credit schemes have been in
operation in a number of developing countries and it is not thought that this
represents an insuperable problem. The economics are discussed in Chapter 3.
In addition, the high cost of present day solar pumping systems can be expected to
fall substantially through improvements in performance and design, and through
economies resulting from an increasing scale in manufacture.
On the national level, the widespread deployment of solar pumps would help to
improve food production (and alleviate rural poverty in the process) largely
through the better use of local resources of land, labour, ground water and
sunlight. This would be achieved without the increases in petroleum imports (with
consequent’ balance of payments probiems), which would be needed if ’
conventional oil fuelled engines or rural electrification were used.
The maximum benefits on the national level would be obtained if a high level of
local added-value can be introduced into the manufacture of solar pumping systems
to minim& the foreign currency requirements associated with the introduction
and subsequent widespread use. of the technology, as discussed in section 3.4.
Further possible advantages of solar pumps are that they are potentially long lasting
and reliable, if the technology is developed to maturity, compared with small
engines, and the maintenance, servicing and repair skills should be less demanding
and more easily taught then those needed for engines. Hence they are particularly
well suited for use in remote areas where communications and access are difficult
so that a system that is relatively independent of external supply lies has a
significant advantage.
17
Also, for smaU-scale irrigation pumping duties, most land-holdings are sufficiently
small to demand no more than a few hundred watts of pumped output power at
low heads. Small engines do not scale down well to this power level, being
inherently inefficient and lacking in durability when rated at much less than I or
2kW; also the maintenance costs of small engines are a major factor and there are
no significant economies to be found in these when comparing say a 2kW engine
with a 5kW one. Therefore, for very tight pumping duties it is hard to use a small
engine effectively; usually a larger than necessary machine must be used, while
solar pumps on the other hand do scale down without serious diseconomies.
Hence solar pumps are likely to be more competitive with internal combustion
engines forsmalbscale applications and this is confirmed by analysis of available
data. For example Ref. 8 fmds that a 1 ft3/s solar pump would be more
competitive against a similar output engine than a 2 ft”/s unit (= 56.6
lit&.) which is substantially larger than the systems under investigation
for this Project.
Some of the main disadvantages inherent in solar pumps, are:
0 that they represent unfamiliar technology.
0 they are still, in the main, immature and therefore of high unit cost (due
to the present limited scale of production).
0 that standards of reliability, efficiency and longevity are in general not
yet at the level that is required for their widespread adoption.
0 although efficiency will improve with development, and costs will come
down, solar-powered systems will inevitably remain large in relation to
their power rating due to the low power density of sunshine and the
relatively low efficiency with which it can be converted to shaft power for
pumping. Thus they are likely to involve more materials and take up
significantly more land area than engines powered by fuels, or even
than windpumps in areas with sufficient wind to make the latter viable.
2.7 Size and Efticiency Considerations for Solar Pumps
2.7.1 Size. Considerations
For a constant flowrate, irrigation becomes more uneconomic as the head
increases due to the corresponding increase in power demand and hence
unit cost of water. The ternn of reference of this Project assumed that the
likely head for irrigation pumping would be in the range 5 to 10m as there
is much land available having a water table as close as this to the surface.
The majority of farms in developing countries are less than two hectares
in area, and a large proportion are under I ha. As discussed in section 3.2.
this is precisely the size range where engine powered pumps are generally
oversized and too expensive, and hence this is the best opportunity for
solar pumps to prove competitive (see Figure 9). Individual solar pumping
systems, and particularly photovoltaic (PV) systems, do not exhibit
marked economies of scale, but economies may be found in the volume of
production. Hence by manufacturing larger numbers of small units, costs
are likely to come down faster, and if this happens it is possible that the
unit costs for small PV systems will be lower than for larger ones simply
due to the scale of manufacture.
18
Further benefits from the developmenr of small solar pumps would also
be found because:
larger land holdings can make use of several such units (while
still benefitting from the !:w costs resulting from mass
production for a Large marke:).
average distances water has 3 be transmitted would be lower,
and consequently the averap: total pumped head, and water
losses through seepage or evaporation would be reduced. Hence
the power requirements and the unit cost of water would be
reduced.
smaller solar pumping units could be introduced progressively,
thereby reducing the capital sums to be raised to several smaller
amounts rather than one large sum.
a number of smaller units will have a higher reliability, since a
failure would not be so serious as when only one pump was in
use.
the task of water management is substantially easier with a
number of small units, so overall water usage efficiency could
possibly be improved.
Small land holdings of less than 0.5ha are expensive to irrigate, but solar
pumps offer a better prospect than engine pumps. This is shown in
Figure I I and discussed in detail in Chapter 3.
If solar pumps are to be successful, they will require reasonably efticient
water distribution and management, which implies a peak water demand
probably in the 40 to 80 m”/day range per hectare. In practice, and
especially while the technology remains expensive, it will be important to
hold the water requirement at the bottom of this range if irrigation is to
be economically viable. Most water management techniques or improved
distribution systems are likely to be cost-effective if they significantly
improve water application efficiency and hold down the water
requirement. One point in favour of small land holdings is that field losses
are likely to be smaller (as a percentage of water pumped) and water
management is likely to be easier.
Figure 3 illustrates the relationshiop between head, flow rate and pumped
power output and indicates the requirements of a typical 1 .Oha land
holding.
2.1.2 Water utilisation efficiency
A solar pump has to be sized to he able to satisfy the peak irrigation demand
for a given area and these conditions may only last for a relatively
short time: thus at other times of the year the pump is likely to have
excess capacity. Figure 1 illustrates this using the example from Table 2 of
energy availability and irrigation water demarid, for two crops per year

(wheat and cotton) in Chad. It should be noted that the area chosen as an
example is likely to be more favourable than most for the use of solar
pumps due to its low rainfall and high irradiation levels.
It is noticeable in this example that if a solar pump is sized so as just to
satisfy the demand for irrigation water in the month of maximum demand
(June in this example), then considerable surplus capacity will be avallable
in most other months. This is due in part to:
0 variation in crop water demand during the growing cycle.
0 the changeover between crops (when no irrigation water is
required).
0 ram supplementing or replacing irrigation water
The n&t result of this mismatch between power availability and demand
is that (m this example) only about 40% of the solar energy available can
usefully be applied for irrigation. This example is likely to be reasonably
typical; the situation would be better in terms of percentage water utilisation
when there is a shorter time between changeover of crops or when
there is less rain to supplement the irrigation water.
The situation could be even worse since the systems will have to be
oversized even for the month of maximum demand to allow for:
0 years with less then average solar energy availability.
0 the fanner being unable to be present to make effective use of
all available solar energy in the month of maximum demand.
0 solar pumping systems being unable to use the proportion of
solar energy received with a power level lower than that needed
for pumping to commence.
The proportion of available solar energy that can be used will be
dependent upon the climate, crop cycles chosen, type of solar pump
and effectiveness of the water management practised by the farmer,
but it will never be possible to use all the water that can be pumped with
the available energy for an application such as irrigation.
Factors that wiU increase the proportion of solar energy that can be used
include:
0 the use of storage to improve ease of water management and
reduce the peak flow requirements of the pump.
0 multiple CrOFFitlg
0 use of water for other purposes in addition to irrigation.
0 operation in arid regions with even less rainfall then in Chad.
21
2.7.3
A further pOsSibility would be to fmd an alternative use for any surplus
electrical or shaft power.
As the cost of solar pumps falls, the degree of oversizing that can be
tolerated will become greater, but initially it seems that if they are to be
successful it will be in areas where serious oversizing due to extreme
variation in irrigation water demand can be avoided.
Although it was beyond the scope of Phase I of this Project to consider in
detail the utilisation of irrigation water after it leaves the pumping system,
it must be emphasised that the detailed development and subsequent
introduction of small-scale solar pumps in realistic pilot projects cannot be
conducted without consideration of this vital issue.
The way the water is used can have a profound effect on the size of solar
pump required for a particular duty, and hence on the cost; there are
indications that an efficient distribution system coupled with careful
usage could very likely halve the size and cost of pumping system
required.
Both time and money should therefore be invested in field water storage
and distribution systems aimed at improving water application and utilisaticn
efficiencies, as well as in providing the necessary training for at least
the first groups of farmers to use this technology. Such investments are
likely to earn a good return in terms of reducing the sixes of solar pumping
systems needed to perform a given duty as weU as ensuring that the
practices learnt by those farmers who pioneer the use of the technology
are the most appropriate.
System efficiency
The complete “system” for the purposes of analysis includes:
0 the solar resource (incoming solar radiation)
0 the solar pumping system hardware
0 the distribution system “hardware” and water management

”
The contribution of each to overall system efficienty is discussed
below 5
a) The solar resource
As explained in section 2.7.2 it is not possible to utifise more than a
proportion of the solar energy resource that is available. There are two
principal methods for reducing the proportion of solar energy received
which is so diffuse as to be below the system starting threshold; these are
to reduce the threshold or to extend the period in the day when the
irradiation received by the collector is above the threshold.

23
To reduce the starting threshold involves making the system more efficient
and avoiding any hysteresis in the system, such as might be caused
by static friction. For this reason, low static heads centrifugal pumps are
attractive as their starting torque can be less than their running torque.
Although attempts have been made to maximise the use of available
solar irradiation, most manufacturers (whether of small photovoltaic or of
small thermal solar SYstemhSav)e favoured a fared array for simplicity of
manufacture and operation. Hoccver, Figure 4A shows that this
arrangement produces a variable irradiance level through the day closely
approximating a cosine curve. This cute is such that a considerable period
of sunshine in the early morning or late afternoon can be lost so far as a
solar pump is concerned, because the attenuation due to misalignment of
the collector with the sun’s rays reduces the available power below the
starting threshold.
For example, when the array is more than 60 degrees from normal to the
sun, sunlight is attenuated in power density by SO%, (cos 600 = 0.5).
Figure 4A also shows how if the collector is not normal to the sun’s beam
radiation at midday, there is a further attenuation.
Usually such a collector is fixed facing south in the northern hemisphere
or facing north in the southern hemisphere with its plane inclined at an
angle to the ground equal to the latitude of the location. This places the
plane of the collector parallel to the axis of the Earth so that it receives
solar radiation exactly normal to its surface at noon on the equinoxes
which is the fixed position which maximises the solar energy received over
a whole year (in theory, neglecting seasonal weather effects). This presents
problems near the equator, where the collector ideally should be
set horizontally, since it should also be set at a sufficient angle for rain
water run-off to wash away dust and dirt from the collector surface.
At noon in mid-winter and mid-summer, the array will be approximately
23 degrees away from normal, to the sun’s ray, which is the equivalent of
about 1 h 30 min before or after noon at the equinoxes: this represents an
additional attenuation factor of around 8%.
The problem of attenuation of received irradiation can be largely
corrected through the use of an appropriate design which permits the
collector angle to be adjusted seasonally; it is fortunate that cosines of
small angles are quite close to unity; IO degrees lack of normality
represents only 2% attenuation and it takes a full 31 degrees of divergence
from the normal to attenuate the received irradiance by even 10%.
A substantial increase of usable solar energy can be gained by arranging
for a flat plate solar collector to be movable so as to track the sun. If the
array is tracked from east to west, following the sun so that the array is
always normal to the sun’s rays, then in theory the full intensity of sun
tight can be experienced (of around IOOOW/m’) from the moment the sun
is above the east horizon until it starts to go beiow the western horizon at
dusk, (which is the broken rectangular outline indicated in Figure 4B). In

practice, even in very clear desert climates, the considerably increased
thickness of atmosphere traversed by sunlight in the periods immediately
after dawn and before sun-set serve to attenuate the level of radiation
received, even normal to the sun’s rays. As a result the solid cul~e in
Figure 48 indicates the typical variation in irradiance level through the
day if measured normal to the sun. Obviously climatic conditions can
greatly modify these curves, but given clear conditions, they are close to
reality.
By comparing Figures 4A & B, it can be seen that a perfectly tracking
collecter will achieve a given threshold irradiance level earlier in the da%
and permit a longer running time for a solar pump compared with one
having a ftxed collecter. Also, extra energy can be coilected due to the
greater power density available in the sunlight normal to a collector. In
simple geometric terms the extra energy gained by perfect tracking can be
50% or more. The gain can be greater in certain areas where it is commonly
more cloudy in the middle of the day. In addition certain solar
systems can achieve a higher average conversion efficiency if the input
energy variation, between the starting threshold and the maximum, is kept
small.
Perfect solar tracking is difficult to achieve, as it requires that the colletter
be driven with precision through 180 degrees in 12 hours, and that
it varies in inclination as well as in azimuth due to the seasonal motion of
the sun’s apparent path across the sky. It is possible to maintain close to
the optimum orientation of a collector by tracking it in a single plane
normal to the earth’s axis, (i.e. by rotating it about an axis incline zo the
horizontal at an angle equal to the local latitude). Occasional seasonal
adjustment increasing the inclination by up to 23 degrees in mid-winter
and reducing it by the same in mid-summer can marginally improve the
collection of irradiation. As wiU be explained later, really accurate
tracking is only necessary where concentrating collectors with high
concentration ratios are used, in order to keep the focussed image of the
sun on the absorber area.
The’provision of automatic and continuous tracking can greatly complicate
what otherwise would be an extremely simple, fixed system,
and introduce both extra costs and a lower level of reliability. Therefore,
it is interesting to consider a useful compromise involving the occasional
reorientation of a movable “fixed” collector, by hand. Figures 5A and 5B
show the effect of moving such a collector, once per day and twice per
day, respectively. In both cases it is assumed that the collector is optimally
orientated and that it is moved at the correct times.
it is clear that moving such a coUecter once per day extends the running
time for a solar pumping system having a given starting threshold to
almost the same period as with continuous tracking: early morning and
late afternoon performance gains would also be expected. However, a
certain proportion of the peak midday &radiance that would be picked
up by a fixed array is lost.
Figure 5B shows that moving a couector twice per day even allows the
midday peak irradiation to be collected and results in about 95% of the
irradiation available with continuous tracking to be received. Clear’-! there
is substantial potential in tracking, either continuously or occasionally. At
least 40% extra energy can become available through the use of some form
of coffecter reorientation or tracking.
b) Solar pumping “hardware” efficiency
The main objective is to achieve the most cost-effective rather than the
most efficient system. Efficiency, however, is crucially important in order
to minimise system costs, providing it is not pursued so far that
diminishing returns set in. Certainly, the more efficient systems field
tested under this Project also 3 to be the most cost-effective.
Figures 6 and 7 ilhtstrate the instantaneous power flow through a typical
PV and a typical thermal small pumping system. With PV systems most of
the losses occur at the cells in conversion of light to electricity, while in
thermal systems most of the losses are shared between collector heat
losses and the rejected heat and other losses from the heat engine. In
either case, only about 4% of the input energy appears in the form of
hydraulic output.
c) Distribution losses in irrigation
As previously explained, the distribution system wiU involve losses,
either due to water that fails to reach the roots of the crop (through
, leakage, percolation into the soil or evaporation) or due to the energy
used in providing the extra head necessary to distribute the water. With
very low static heads, this latter loss can be substantial.
Bad management can result in further losses, through water not being
directed correctly and running to waste, or thrc ~gb the system not being
used at times when it could be, thereby losing solar energy that could have
been usefully applied.
2.8 Alternative Applications for Solar Pumps
There are two major problems in applying solar pumps for irrigation applicatiom-
0 the low cost for which water must be delivered (less than 6 US cents
(1981) per cubic metre).
0 the relatively variable demand for water,often with high but brief peak
demands and long periods with no demand at all.
Both of these require a lower cost system than can readily be manufacturered at
present and either subsidies or large and speculative investments are needed to produce
the breakthrough to high volume manufacture and low unit costs that is
needed.

However, the provision of pumped water supplies from boreholes or wells in
remote and arid or semi-arid regions wig tolerate rather higher investment costs
(and unit water costs? than irrigation and also tends to bs an end-use with a
steadier year-round water demand. It is likely that solar pumps, even at cwrent
prices, might be at or close to economic viability for such applications, providing
the pumping head is not too great. It is precisely for this kind of application
that the autonomy of a solar pump is a valuable asset; the low level of maintenance
that is (at least in principle) possible coupled with long life and no fuel requirements
makes the technology po:entiaUy attractive to those instihrtions responsible
for maintaining remote water supplies.
It was beyond the scope of Phase I of the Project to look at applications other than
irrigation, but these will be considered in the future phases of the Project.
It may be that through the initial use of solar pumps for premium applications like
water supply, the scale of manufacture will develop to a level where prices drop
and the prospects for using solar pumps for irrigation substantially improve. However,
most water supply applications will be through high pumping heads (greater
than IOm) with the consequent deployment of positive displacement pumps,
whereas centrifugal pumps are more appropriate for the low pumping heads (up to
IOm) which are generally required for economic irrigation pumping. Therefore,
although there is considerable overlap in the technical requirements for both
end-uses, there are also some significant differences.
Another important possible application for small-scale solar pumps is to
provide water for cattle and other livestock in semi-arid regions from boreholes. Again,
a higher unit water output cost is tolerable and the demand is steadier than for
irrigation.
A possible virtue of small-scale solar pumps for this application, in addition to the
obvious ones of needing little in the way of external supplies or maintenance,
is that they can be sized economically to produce a much smaller output than is
readily possible with engines. A major problem with the provision of water for
livestock in developing countries is overgrazing that can result from excessive
concentration of animals around large-output watering points. The provision of a
greater nuinber of smaller watering points would mean that herds could be limited
in number and hence more efficient use made of the available grazing.
Pumping with a small flow rate over a longish time period, as with a solar pump
may also have advantages in areas where there is a large draw-down on the well at
higher flow rates, or where the well may even be pumped drywhen using an engine
(which can cause severe damage to the well and pump).
It is worth noting that to achieve the declared goals of the current IIN
International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade, new water supplies
will have to be commissioned to provide for the needs of an average of half-amillion
people every day of the decade until 199 I. There seems little doubt that
solar pumps could and will play a useful part if a programme as ambitions as this is
to succeed.

3. ECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL FEASIBILJTY
3.1 I”iWd”CC0”
The previous chapter has reviewed the potential role of small solar pumps in
irrigation practice and deliberately avoided more detailed discussion of the
economic, technical and developmental questions which need to be resolved if solar
pumps are to be used successfully in practice.
This chapter is in three parts:
0 system economics
n technical requirements
0 importance of local manufacture
In the section on system economics a description is given of an economic
evaluation of and comparison between solar pumps and engine pumps designed to
irrigate 0.5 ha. A baseline model was fust developed and run, and a sensitivity
analysis was then performed to test the way in which the economic picture was
affected by variation of the more important assumptions implicit in the model.
The section on technical requirements is based on the experience of the
Consultants on the Project with the systems undergoing field tests. It illustrates
that attention to practical design points, simplicity of operation and reliability is as
important as high efficiency.
The final section in the chapter discusses the critical role of local manufacture of
part assembly in the introduction of a new technology into a developing country
and the difficulties of implementing such a policy.
3.2 System Economics
3.2.1 An economic model for sensitivity analysis
It is difficult to make absolute economic judgements on small-scale
solar pumps because not only is the technology immature but also
evaluation is made difficult by the variability and uncertainty of many
parameters that affect the pump system economics.
One of the economic guidelines proposed by the World Bank for the
Project was that the cost of irrigation water delivered to the field should
not be more than 80.05 per cubic metre (1919; the equivalent fgure for
1981 may be taken as $0.06 per cubic metre). This was taken to be a
globally representative fgure which, if attained, would mean that the
extra income obtained from the additional crops would yield a reasonable
return. The adoption of this figure does not imply either that in certain
areas pumps providing water at a greater *cost will not be viable or that, if
the cost is lower the pump will necessarily be economic.
31
3.2.2
Despite such uncertainties it is possible to set up a plausible “baseline”
economic model and use this as a tool to investigate the sensitivity of solar
pumping system costs to variation of different parameters. Such a model
can also be used to indicate the relative costs of a solar pump compared
with alternative and competitive options.
The analysis was conducted in purely economic terms and in principle
considered all the costs to the economy regardless of who incurs them.
Financial costs, e.g. subsidies and taxes, were excluded because these
represent a transfer of money within the economy rather than a cost to
it. In many cases there may be no truly economic means to produce
increased food crops, in the sense that for social reasons food needs to be
underpriced, particularly in countries with poor populations. So the fact
that in many cases neither engines nor solar prumps appear to be
economicaUy viable needs to be viewed in that context.
The economic analysis was based on 1981 US dollars prices for present
day costs, allowing for inflation. at a rate appropriate to each of the
individual inputs to the projected cash flows, rather than differential
inflation.* A real discount rate of 10% was assumed when compared
to the general rate of inflation.
While the absolute cost figures in the model will mly be indicative, they
can be used to draw helpful comparisons on the :osts of delivered water,
as wall as on their relativities, and their sensitivir I to alterations in key
state variables or design parameters. This model ias been used to compare
the effects of varying different key parameters on the relative costs of
small-scale solar pumps and small engine driver: pumps. The reason for
comparing solar pumps witb engine driven pun-as is that much of the
current interest in solar-powered pumping stenl~ from the substantial
increase in petroleum-based fuel costs during the last decade; hence such a
comparison gives an indication of the soundness (or otherwise) of
substituting solar pumps for engine-driven pumps, but in itself will not
demonstrate the economic smmdness of either alternative.
For the purposes of examining the general parameters that affect
solar-pumping system costs, the model considers one of the most costeffective
PV systems, representative of best current practice, and applies
suitable assumptions as to the likely future inflation rate that will affect
replacement systems and maintenance costs. Any radical technical
developments that could affect the economics through step changes in
typical performance or costs are not considered; such possibilities are
discussed in following chapters and would of course make solar pumping
that much more viable.
“Baseline” Model Assumptions
I.
The analysis for the model was run on a computer which was programmed
with the parameters indicated in Table 4. These parameters are solar pump
related or engine related or external parameters which are independent of
* It is appreciated that it is more usual to make economic analyses at
constant (1981) prices, allowing only fcr differential movement in
prices, but in this case which involved inflating different cash streams at
different rates it was more convenient to do the calculations in the way
described.

the type of pumping system.
A 1981 s,stem unit capital cost of US dollars S IO/W peak was assumed,
where peak watts correspond to the array rated electrical output in an
irradiance of 1000W/mZ with a PV system. Prices of the most costeffective
systems currently available are in fact approximately twice to
three times this level but it would not be realistic to use prices relating to
systems that are manufactured in the small individually hand-assembled
quantities currently applicable for solar pumps, and then to compare the
apparent economic costs with such a mature product as a mass-produced
diesef pumping system.
The price of S IO/W pk is used because that appears to be the economic
price of a small-scale solar pump (of around 200-300W array output in
peak sunlight conditions) if it is manufactured and shipped in quantity.
The breakdown is approximately S7IWpk for the army and S3/Wpk for
the Balance of System (BOS). The latter consists of a motor at typically
S300, a pump at S250, and it is assumed that the packaging, electrical
connections and pipework plus the array support structure could be
provided for no more than around S 200, giving a total of S 750 or
S3/Wpk with a 25OW system. It is also assumed that various optimisations
.discussed in the companion Project Report, which can improve the system
cost-effectiveness will have been successfully implemented to achieve the
perfonnancelcost requirements necessary for S 10/W pk. There is
obviously some uncertainty about this assumption, but the value of a
sensitivity analysis is that if the baseline assumptions are thought to be
wrong, the effect of changing them can readily be assessed(s ee example of
Figures9, lOand II).
In the analysis, the system life is calculated from the assumed operating
Life and the calculated number of hours per year of running time required
to meet the water demand. In the baseline model an operating life of
15000 hours is assumed; there is no guarantee any present-day system will
actually achieve this, but a life of this order is necessary if reasonably low
costs are to be achieved. Motor brushes (if fitted), motor and pump
‘bearings, and almost certainly the pump impeller will have to be replaced
during this period, but an average annual maintenance cost of S 100 is
assumed to allow for this. Also the array, which is a major cost element,
will quite probably exceed the life-time requirement assumed.
.
Finally, the solar pump subsystem (motor and pump) is assumed to have
an overall efficiency of 40% (on average) which is in line with tl¶e best
small subsystems currently available. It is assumed that the baseline
system efficiency is at the highest level currently achieved by the best
small-scale solar pumping systems (4.4%), since any production model will
require to be well optimised if it is to succeed.
The period used in the economic analysis to calculate the system
annualised capital cost was taken as equal to the system life.
The baseline engine is assumed to be the smallest diesel type generally in
widespread use, i.e. of about 3kW rate power. However, it is derated to
67% of peak power (this is the average running power assumed, including
idling time) and the average engine shaft output efficiency is taken as
IS%. Various references were consulted for costs and the consensus
arrived at was about S6OO/kW (rated). Useful references for this and other
parameters were (81, (9), (IO), (ll), (12) and (13). As with the solar
pump, the fife of the engine is calculated from its estimated operating life
(typically 2000 hours for a small diesel in tropical field conditions).
Maintenance costs are taken as SO.50 per hour, which is a reasonable
average figure especially as they do not greatly influence total annual cash
flows (see the sensitivity analysis curves of Figure 9).
The value of 40% assumed for the engine subsystem efficiency includes
the pump, pipework losses (at low heads the pipe function and related
losses can be a large proportion of the total head for engine pumps) plus
any mechanical transmission if the engine is not directly coupled to the
pump. This is not a best, but an average efficiency, and is in line with the
practical results such as reported in Reference 15 with regard to
kerosene-fuelled irrigation pumps in Sri Lanka.
The external parameters consist of economic assumptions on discount and
inflation rates, together with information on the water demand, head and
the two energy resources - irradiation per day and fuel costs. It is worth
emphasising that the assumptions on discount rates and inflation are not
generally applicable but are simply taken as reasonable economic values to
test the sensitivity of the costs of the two systems to variations in them.
The overall period taken for the baseline analysis should be a whole
multiple of the Lives of each of the capital items which require replacement:
in this case 11 years for the solar pump and 7 years for the engine.
The baseline analysis was done for a period of 22 years, allowing for one
solar pump replacement and two engine. replacements. The eight year life
of the second replacement engine wiU have negligible effect on the figures.
The discount rate should be real (i.e. in a model using inflated cash flows
greater than the inflation rate by the discount rate chosen) and reflect the
opportunity cost of capital. Therefore, for the baseline model, the
differential between the discount and general future inflation rate is taken
as 10%. Fuel price inflation, which has risen substantially more than that
(of the order of 25% per annum in the last few years) is taken as 15%.
Because solar pumps are an immature technology, with falling costs in real
terms anticipated as the production volume of solar PV cells in particular
increases, the inflation rate applicable to them wiU be lower than the
general rate of inflation, and substantially lower than the likely inflation
rate for petroleum-based fuel costs. The inflation rate applicable to the
replacement costs of solar pumping systems has been assumed to be 5%
i.e. at half the general infiation rate. This is an unavoidable weakness in
the analysis as it certainly would not be correct to assume that solar
pump costs will increase in lime with general inflation, but there is no
certain way of judging whether the average rate chosen for the baseline
model is realistic, although it is believed that it is not seriously incorrect.
35
The pump operating head for the baseliie model is taken as 5m as a
representative vahm. At lower heads the application will be more
economic, but the costs of irrigation as higher heads may not make it a
widely applicable technology for some time.
The land area to be commanded by the baseline model was taken as OSha,
as this requires a solar-pumping system capable of being portable, of a not
unreasonable capital cost and which would compete particularly well with
engine powered pumps as they are least competitive for such small, but
common land holdings. The market for a system of this size would appear
to be sufficiently large to permit significant economies to be made
through mass production.
The model’s irrigation water demand and its variability are for a mean
water requirement (over the year) of 20m3/day (40m3 /ha. day) and a
maximum of 50m3 /day (100 m3 /h&day). This compares with 47 and
103m3/ha.day for the Chad example previously used by way of
ihustration (see Table 2). The Chad data are of interest as they represent
an area which should be favourable for the use of solar powered pumps
due to its low rainfall and high irradiance levels. The baseline data are
representative of a slightly less, but still favourable area.
As indicated in Figure I, only a fraction of output can usefully be applied
to the crops; this is the Utilisation Factor, (given in the “computed
results” of Table 4). The size of system needed to meet the specified
maximum monthly water demand is calculated for the irradiation
conditions specified for that month. From this, the Utilisation Factor is
calculated by dividing the average water demand specified for the year by
that for the month of maximum demand. This factor gives a measure of
the oversizing oi a solar pumping system required to cater for the
variability of irrigation water demand. With the baseline example the
Utilisation Factor is 0.4 (i.e. the average water demand over the year is
40% of that in the peak month); in the Chad example, the Utilisation
factor works out at 46% and there are probably few places where a more
favourable factor than this might be found.
The baseline engine fuel costs were set at S 0.40/l&, which is a
reasonable economic cost for 1981 but which makes no allowance for
inland transport (to deliver fuel in the field) and storage costs that will
possibly add substantially to this figure in remote areas. Shortages of
diesel fuel in many developing countries cannot be addressed by this
simple economic model.
However Figures 8 and 9 allow the effect of higher fuel costs to be taken
into account and are not large for such a lightly used engine as in the
baseline model. These costs have no bearing on solar pump economics per
SC
Subsequent runs varying the parameters to allow an assessment to be
made of what would happen with a different baseline from that chosen
“are described later.

3.2.3 Baseline Model Results
Various key properties of the resulting system were calculated and these
appear as “computed results” at the foot of Table 4. The annual cash
flows of the solar and engine pumps for every year from 198 1 to 2002
comprising the sum of the uniform equivalent annual costs of capital,
annual maintenance costs and annual fuel costs, are shown in Table 5. The
World Bank’s figure of 5 c/m3 (1979) for water has been inflated at the
general rate for comparison with an average unit cost of water calculated
from the annual cash flow for each year on the b&s of a daily volume of
20m3.
It must be appreciated that the annual cash flows (and the derived figures
for average unit cost of water) depend on maintenance of the 22 year
perspective for the economic analysis; if a 5 year or 10 year period were
taken the results would be different. Steps in the equivalent annual coat of
capital occur at years when replacement systems are required and the
capital sums for replacements have been increased at the appropriate
inflation rate.
The model calculates the Present Worth (PW) for each of the cash flows
for the two options over the 22 year period of t’le analysis. The PW
assessment enables an economic comparison to be made of the two sets of
cash flows, each of which contains different patterns of expenditure over
time. The results are given at the foot of Table 5.
For the baseline assumptions, over the 22 year period, the solar pump
option has a PW just greater than that for the engine. In the view of all the
uncertainties inherent in such analysis this slight difference is of no
significance and on the basis of these assumptions there is nothing to
choose between the systems on economic grounds.
The average unit cost of water each year is indicative of the way in which
the economics of the two systems are moving relative to the target cost of
water (inflated at the general level of 10%). As will be seen the trend is for
the solar pump economics to improve while the economics of the engine
pump deteriorates. If the analysis had been conducted over a shorter
period the PW of the engine pump annual costs would have been lower
than those for the solar pump, and if it had been taken over a longer
period (ignoring the great uncertainties in so doing) the PW of the solar
pumps would have had a more marked advantage over the engine.
3.2.4 Sensitivity Analysis
Key parameters in the baseline model were systematically varied to
investigate the sensitivity of the comparison between solar-powered and
engine-driven pumps to such variations. A programme of 28 such variations
was completed, as indicated in Table 6. In all such computer runs, the
key factors outlined in the column headed “description” in Table 6 were
changed, although in some cases several parameten had to be changed to
make the new model realistic.

Some of the changes investigated in the sensitivity analysis m wt TVa t ‘he
system lives of the solar pump and engine pump (consistent u’l:h c Levi ting
hours of 15000 and 2000 - see Table 4) would not be I 1 years and 7
years, as in the baseline analysis. To simplify the sensitivity analysis a
uniform period of 20 years was adopted: even though this may not
correspond with whole multiples of the lives of the two pumps, the error
will be very small and make no difference to the conclusions.
Some key results of these runs are summarised along with the descriptions
in Table 6.
3.25 Discussion of the Indications from the Economic Model Anal. sis
a) General
The absolute values obtained from the model can only be
regarded as indicative, due to the large number of assumptions
made, but the trends indicated by varying individual parameters
are generally fundamental to the economics of small solar and
small engine-powered pumping systems and are of potential
significance in evaluating such systems under different
conditions.
Table 6 provides a useful summary of key indicators that vary
with the changed parameters. For example, factors that change
the actual energy demand (i.e. changes in head or gross water
demand) cause significant changes in solar pump capital cost and
in engine fuel costs. This is a fundamental difference between the
two systems; the solar pump only has a finite daily energy input
per unit area of collector, so changes in demand require changes
in size and hence capital cost, but the engine can run more or less
to suit demand and simply uses more or less fuel in proportion*.
A second-order effect for the engine is that maintenance costs
and the periods between replacement engines are a function of
the average number of operating hours per day, which varies with
demand. Large variations in demand will dictate the need for a
larger or smaller engine, as is discussed in more detail in the
analysis of the results that follow.
The effects of varying key parameters are perceivable from
Figure 8, which shows the annual operating costs of selected
systems. Figure 8 also illustrates the effects of different assumptions
on inflation and discount rates on the unit water costs.
Some of the more significant influences on the unit cost of
water, revealed by the analysis, for solar pumps are set out in the
form of a sensitivity diagram in Figure 9 and these are discussed
in turn in the sub-sections below.
* This is the case for the comparison made in the analysis because the minimum
practicable size of the engine (3kW) was still much more powerful than needed
for the duty proposed. If it had been technically feasible to adopt an engine
size which required it to run for 24 hours, the economic analysis would have
demonstrated that installed power and capital cost were material factors.

Variations in Pumping Head
The solar system capital costs and the engine system fuel costs
are directly proportional to head, all other things being equal.
Engine maintenance and capital costs are sensitive to head
variation, as the higher the head the longer it has to run per year
and it therefore requires more maintenance and more frequent
replacement. By contrast, solar maintenance costs are a fixed
sum and independent of head.
However, the solar pumping system has to be resized if the head
is changed, but the engine need not be (it can slmpb~ run longer
per day), so the capital cost ratio of solar pumps to engines
increases with head. In other works, a “baseline” solar pump at
2.5m head is less tb?:, the 1981 capital cost of the baseline
engine, but one fi~r 10m has to be nearly four times the baseline
engine cost.
Variation in the head also effects the Present Worth ratio, (i.e.
life-time operating costs ratio), and the unit water costs of solar
compared with diesel, year by year. Increasing the head, according
to the model, makes solar increasingly uncompetitive with
the engine mainly because the engine has to be worked harder, so
its “load factor” improves.
Figure 10 shows how variations in head affect the unit water
costs and how these relate to the assumed unit capital cost of the
solar pumping system. It shows that for a solar pumping system
to achieve the required 6 c per cum. at 5m pumping head, a unit
capital cost of only $5/W pk is required if all the other baseline
system assumptions apply. Presently available systems costing
over $20/W pk can only be economically viable (on the 6clm3
assumption) for heads of little more than lm.
Variations in Gross Water Demand
This has a similar effect on the relative capital costs of the
baseline systems as varying the head, since it also causes a
pro-rata change in energy requirement. i.e. the water demand for
1 ha requires four times the size of solar pump and four times the
fuel for an engine pump as for 0.25 ha. Hence the capital cost
ratio between solar and engines diverges with increasing land area
or water demand.
The affects of water demand (or area of land commanded) on
unit water costs are shown in Figure 11, for various assumptions
on solar system unit capital costs and for the baseline and the
baseline doubled engine fuel costs.

reeson to consider the use of solar pumps for small land holdings
rather than large ones, (see Table 6). The capital cost ratio
virtually increases pm-rata with land area, from about unity at
under half a hectare to 3.55 at 1 ha (and 7 for 2 ha, and so
on).
d) Variations in Utilisation Factor
The sensitivity diagram, Figure 9, indicates how increasing the
solar pump Utilisation Factor by smoothing demand variations
wiU significantly reduce unit output costs. A doubling of the
Utilisation Factor reduces water costs by 17% (either by requiring
a smeller system or by making a given system more productive),
while halving it will increase unit costs by 70% It is of great
importance with solar pumps to achieve a good Utilisation Facto]
through applications with as consistent as possible year round
water demand.
Engines on the other hand do not cost so much when they are
no: in use, and so poor Utilisation Factors do not significantly
affect their water costs as much as solar. Therefore, solar water
pumps become decreasingly competitive with engines in
situations where the demand radically varies through the year e.g.
where there is an extensive rainy season.
e) The Effect of Different Inflation and Discount Rates
Figures 8 and 9 show that the annual cost of solar pumps are
highly sensitive to discount rate assumptions. Figure 8 indicates
that halving the baseline discount rate gives a 30% reduction in
annual costs, while doubting it gives a 70% increase. Halving the
discount rate from 20% to 10% effectively means a nil return on
capital invested since the general inflation rate is 10%. Although
this is unlikely to occur it is valid for the purposes of sensitivity
analysis and shows how the economics of solar pumps become
more favourable compared with engines if the opportunity cost
of capital is low.
As noted in section 3.1, it was not within the scope of the
economic analysis to consider the financial strategy required to
make the pumps affordable in the context of the introduction
of new technology to a developing country. Such a financial
strategy would consider reducing the tinanciai cost to the farmer
by subsidised capital costs or interest rates and would represent a
transfer of resources within the economy: this would only be
considered once the basic economic viability of the pumps had
been established.
Figure 8 also indicates the substantial effect different fuel price
inflation rates have on engine annual operating costs: an increase
from the baseline assumption of 15% fuel price inflation to 25%
causes engine annual operating costs virtually to double by the
I
41
year 2000, by which time the engine operating costs would be
over four times the baseline solar pump costs, and three times the
acceptable level for h-rigation pumping.
The effect of assuming different fuel costs at year 1 has less
significance for engine pumping system output costs in year 1
than might be expected due to the very small demands on the
engine which result in fuel being only a small proportion of costs.
In year 1, with the baseline example, fuel is oniy 13% of total
engine running costs, although by 2000 it is over 30% even with
only a 5% differential between fuel and general inflation. With
kerosene or gasoline engines, which are of lower capital cost but
lower efficiency, fuel would account for a considerably greater
percentage of total costs.
0 Solar Pump System Operational Life Assumptions
Reducing the working life of the solar pumping system has a
major infhtence on costs. This is shown in Figure 8 where a
system with an assumed life of “only” 7500 hours running time
(cf. the baseline at 15000) will have been replaced twice as often
and amortized over half the period, resulting in annual operating
costs approximately twice those of the baseline system. 7500
hours is actually quite a respectable lifer for most machinery and
15000 hours is exceptionally long for small machines, (for
example, cars typically have an operating life of the order of
2500 to SO00 hours). Therefore a lot of attention to detail will
be required from solar pumping system designers if such long
lifetimes are to be reliably achieved.
Figure 9 illustrates what will happen if such long lifetimes are not
achieved: for example a reduction to “only” 6000 hours r?s&s
in a 70% increase in unit water output costs: the same as increasing
the baseline solar pumping system unit capital costs from $10
to 6 17. In practice, it seems likely that the array could last much
longer than the motor and pump unit, (possibly with a life of 20
years or more). This could be offset against subsystems with a
shorter life than that indicated desirable by the present analysis.
Attempting to increase the operational life from 15000 hours,
which would be technically difficult, appears to give diminishing
returns.
Solar pumping irrigation systems should be designed and
constructed for a life in excess of 10000 hours if they are to have
the best prospects of becoming economically viable.
48
8) Solar Pump System Efficiency
Varying the subsystem efficiency has the same effect as varying
the solar pumping system overall efficiency by the same proportion.
Any technical improvements which affect system efficiency
will have a similar economic effect, whether they involve just the
subsystem (motor and pump) or whether they include the PV
may.
For one model run an improvement in average subsystem
efficiency from 40 to 50% was trisd which yielded a 17%
improvement in costs. This is just technically feasible through
good design, but must be close to the upper limit for such small
motors and pumps.
More profound are the negative effects of worse than the baseline
system efficiency. A 20% reduction in efficiency, from 40% to
32% (typical of many current solar pumping systems) results in a
26% increase in unit costs. Some of the poorest subsystems
tested under the UNDP Project field test programme were only
around 25% efficient; these would have unit output costs over
90$/b greater than for the baseline model. Lower efficiencies than
this would be quite catastrophic to the economics.
h) Solar Pumping Systems Considered as a “Mature Product”
Ii the unit capital cost of solar pumps falls substantially due to
mass production, then the opportunities for further price reductions
will become less marked and solar pumps will begin to
increase in cost more in line with the general rate of inflation; in
other words they will have become a “mature product”.
In one run a higher inflation mte of 10% was envisaged for the
solar pump replacement costs to emulate the effect. This is what
would tapper! if sc!ar pcrrzps ceased tc, get any cheaper in real
terms than E IO/W pk ir 196i. The result is a I 10% increase in
soiar pump Present Worth which makes the solar pump just fail
to deliver water within the 6c/mJ limit for most of the period
considered.
A more likely scenario if solar pumps ever develop to maturity is
that their costs might drop to around $ S/W pk (in 1981 real
terms) and then cease to get lower in real terms compared with
the general inflation rate. Under this condition (run 20 in Table
6). a favourable Presest Worth ratio is also obtained against the
engine pump and evw the solar pump tint-cost is lower than that
of the engine.
3.2.6 Conclusions from the Baseline Model Analysis
It appears that solar pumps will need to satisfy a number of economic and
technical requirements if they are to pump water at an economic unit
cost. Key requirements are:-
49
a) solar pumping system capital cost down to be under SSjW pk (in
I98 1 real terms) when product achieves maturity (full volume
production).
b) solar pumping system life to average in excess of 10000 hours
(preferably about 15000 hours) before any major replacement
costs are incurred.
C) solar pump subsystem efficiency to be at least 40% and preferably
better (giving an overall efficiency of at least 4.5%) over a
reasonable range of operating conditions.
Until solar pump capital costs fall in real terms to less than about $5/W
pk, solar pumps will generally only be economically preferable to diesel
pumps for small land-holdings having average water demands in the 10 to
30 m3 per day range.
It is possible to combine features identified by the model as helping to
reduce the costs of solar pumps to achieve earliest utihsation. For
example, improved system efficiency, combined with increased life and
offered at a subsidised price or with a soft loan in the interests of
producing cheap food; ii in addition the technology is initially popularised
in very low head applications in small land-holdings where the water
demand is relatively steady, then further cost reductions may be expected.
3.2.7 The Capital Cost Barrier to the Introduction of Solar Pumps
From the point of view of the economy of the country as a whole, the
criterion for choice of solar powered pump or engine pump should be the
PW of the annual cash flows over the twenty year period. These are given
in Table 6 for each of the sensitivity analyses: any PW ratio (solar/enghte)
of less than unity means that a solar-powered pump represents the more
economic option. This condition occurred for higher fuel costs, lower
pumping heads and water demands, lower discount rates, more efficient
solar subsystems, increased solar pump lives and lower solar pump capital
costs.
However the capital costs of solar-powered pumps are a crucial factor in
their adoption by farmers, since the capital cost is the predominant
influence on the average unit cost of water delivered. For this reason the
capital costs of solar pumps and engines were compared for each of the
sensitivity analyses in the last three columns of Table 6. The fit cost of
the solar pumps was lower than that of the engine in only three instances:
when either the pumping head was halved (to 2.5”) the water demand
irss halved (equiva!ent to an L7iga&.. aF$a C‘c nY *-“.“T.*l_, ,- -r the capkil iost
of the solar pump was halved to $5 per peak watt; the first two of these
analyses were equivalent of course to the halving of pump capacity and
first cost.
SO
This capital cost barrier is one that can only be overcome by action taken
by the Government or related national institutions. Farmers of small
land-ho!dings in developing countries are very poor and possess no capital
resources of their own, nor do they have ready access to private
institutional timance. As was noted in section 2.6 once Governments are
convinced that solar pumps represent a genuinely economic means of
pumping water, consideration can then be given to providing the finance
necessary for the purchase of the pumps on terms which the farmers can
acceptThis will probably mean a subsidy of one kind or another, implying
a transfer of financial resources within the economy of the country: the
acceptability and extent of such subsidy will depend on the policies of the
Government towards the agricultura! sector, the improved agricultural
yields that may be obtained, the energy situation of the couniry and any
reduction in oil imports which may result. Government backed
agricultural credit schemes have been in operation for a number of years
and their extension to the provision of solar pumps would not involve any
change in principle.
However, it is not yet certain that the various technical and economic
barriers to solar pump usage for irrigation will necessarily be overcome.
Solar pumps are probably already economic for certain more remote
water supply applications (as distinct from irrigation applications) where
higher unit water costs are acceptable; it may be that the necessary boost
to their development through quantity production will come initially
through their wider use for water supplies in developing countries rather
than immediately for crop irrigation.
3.3 Technical Requirementa
3.3.1 General
The detailed aspects of solar pumping system design are covered more
fully in the companion Project Report and in the sections that follow, but
certain general points are worth making at this stage.
Any pumping system for general use by farmers in developing countries
(or for that matter by farmers anywhere) must be capable of reliable
operation with minimal maintenance under harsh operating conditions.
All equipment must therefore be constructed to the standards required
for a long and reliable life under agricultural field conditions and major
system components should achieve a useful life of the order of 10,000
hours or more. To do this requires robustness and high quality of
construction.
In addition to aU the normal hazards of general wear and tear and
corrosion faced by machinery, solar pumping systems (in particular PV
arrays) are likely to be subjected to rough treatment and careless operation:
also, there is no guarantee that the operator will respect manufacturers’
instructions, so the system should be effectively fail-safe; there should
be no modes of self-destruction due to possible operatorerror.
! 51
It should be remembered that the points made in this section refer to
equipment purchased in late 1979 and early 1980. Many manufacturers
are of course aware of the need for improvement to their products and
future progress will be considerably aided by collaboration between them
and the users of their products, and the international agencies and their
consultants employed on projects of this type.
3.3.2 General Limitations of Current Equipment
During the course of the Project the Consultants purchased and assessed
the performance of a number of small-scale solar pumping systems under
tield conditions (in association with leading local institutions) in Mali,
Philippines and Sudan.
As expected this work indicated that solar pumps can be an attractive
technology, with few mechanical components to go wrong and needing
little maintenance. However several problems were encountered in installing
and commissioning the systems, and some of these point to ways in
which the technology might be improved. Also a few of the systems
performed badly or unreliably due to either conceptual or detail design
CliTOt5.
It should also be added that both the Consultants and the various host
country institutions involved provided professional engineers to supervise
the assembly, commissioning and runrdng of the systems (the Consultants
Resident Engineers also visited the relevant manufacturers’
factories to witness the systems being tested prior to shipping). Despite
the well trained personnel involved and the close connection to the
supplier, many systems presented difficulties in commissioning of one
kind or another - most were minor, but in one or two cases it proved
possible to get the systems to run only after modifying them in the field,
and then with difficulty and with performance below specification. In
view of these problems the Consultants believe that some improvements
are necessary before such systems can be assembled and successfully
operated by small farmers in developing countries, although the potential
for achieving the necessary degree of reliability and simplicity is certainly
there.
AU but one of the systems tield tested were solar photovoltaic (PV), the
only thermal system field tested was relatively immature and suffered
a number of teething troubles that made the results of the tests inconclusive.
This imbalance does not necessarily imply that PV systems
are inherently superior to thermal systems, rather that it is more difficult
to improvise a thermal system from off-the-shelf components because
virtuaUy all components require to be purpose-designed. Thus most of the
fmt-hand practical observations which can be made at this stage refer to
PV systems (although some would be common to either type).
52
3.3.3 Technical Concepts
Some examples ioilow which illustrate that there are likely to be good and
bad conceptual approaches to small-scale solar pumping system design.
For example, a large proportion of the systems tes,ted in the Project used
su:face-mounted suction-pumps, possibly because the specification was
for low head applications (in line with the needs oismall-scale irrigation),
often pumping from surface water or from open wells. It appears more
straightfonvard to design a suction pump system for such installations and
also, it is easier to construct such a system by combining off-the-shelf
components (this may have more to do with the manufacturer’s convenience
than with the needs of the fmal user).
However, a problem with suction pumps is priming them and maintaining
their prime. This proved difficult and compromised the performance of at
least two of the PV surface-mounted centrifugal suction pumps. Loss of
prime can readily occur through a leaking footvalve. It only needs a
particle of grit to lodge between the footvalve and its seat for all the water
to drain back from the system as soon as the pump slows down or stops
due to the sun being obscured briefly by a cloud, or at night.
Some of the pumps that more readily held their prime and avoided
associated cavitation problems were vulnerable to damage in the event of
running dry through loss of prime. One otherwise satisfactory pump burnt
out its gland packing through running dry and thereafter leaked quite
badly until a new seal was fitted, and another got so hot that it caused
plastic pipe fittings to soften and distort. Only one manufacturer
attempted to make their suction pump fail-safe by supplying a float
switch to cut off the system if the water level fell too far but which
would not cut off the system in the event of simple loss of prime. The
only precaution another manufacturer took was to attach a lable to the
pump to warn against running the pump dry.
Although the positive-displacement surface-mounted suction-pumps
that were supplied self-primed more effectively and tended to maintain
their prime, they are inefficient at low heads and also relatively large and
expensive.
Only three of the PV systems tested incorporated submerged pumps but
in the Consultant’s view these are the only options for this application.
This was confirmed in practice, as the two best performers proved to be
submerged pumps.
One other rzment of system design which needs more attention from
system suppliers, is the type of installation envisaged; is everything to be
bolted down on concrete foundations or is it possible to make a portable
system that can easily be carried into place and quickly installed. Only
53
one supplier, provided the latter type of system, which was more
straightforward to assemble and commission as a result. All the others
required the casting of concrete foundations which may be needed if a
considerable length of piping full of water has to be supported or where
the stability of arrays under high winds has to be considered. Bolted down
equipment may be more secure from theft, but on the other hand a
portable system can be taken into the fanner’s courtyard at night for
safekeeping.
Solar-powered systems are commonly specified by their power rating
under peak sunlight conditions (usually given as lOOOW/mr) and a
number of manufacturers compromised the performance of their systems
under the more common it-radiance levels of about half peak sunlight
conditions. The problems of system optimization are discussed in detail in
the relevant chapters, but it would seem better if the trend of rating
systems under peak sunlight conditions were changed to specifying the
daily pumped output, perhaps under a standard solar day of say 6kWh/ma
of received solar energy. In the end it is the volume of water that is
pumped in a day, rather than the flow rate under peak sunlight
conditions, that matters.
A number of systems were supplied with inadequate instructions, components
missing and components assembled incorrectly by the manufacturer.
This was partially due to the prototype status of some of the
systems tested, and the relatively short delivery time allowed.
The needs and problems of the manufacturer still appear to weigh heavier
at this early stage in the development of the technology than those of the
end-user. For systems to be tailored more to the end-user will demand less
reliance on “off-the-shelP’ construction and more emphasis on the
“purpose designing” of components, a trend which may even make such
systems initially more expensive due to the component development costs
that will be incurred coupled with the small initial volume of production
that is likely.
In the meantime, the use of “off-the-shelf’ components will no doubt
haVe an important role to play in to popularising the technology and in
gaining further field experience, providing serious conceptual errors that
could bring the technology into disrepute are avoided.
3.3.4 Detailed Design Points
One problem requiring further attention is the vulnerability to damage of
PV arrays and solar collectors for thermal systems, particularly in transit
from the factory. The array is the most expensive single subassembly for
a PV system, and it generally uses a glass cover. In the case of thermal flat
plate systems breakage need involve no more than the cost of replacing
the glass, but with PV systems a broken cover generally means an
54
unusable module. Some of the modules used were rated at as much as
IOOW peak, which implies a replacement cost of around S 1,000. A
number of breakages of this kind were experienced during the first Phase
of the Project, both during delivery and in the field.
Two simple solutions to this problem might be the wider use of high
quality plastic module covers (such as polycarbonates), which would
perhaps mean a marginal loss of performance, and a marginal increase in
cost, but a large improvement in durability. Alternatively, instead of the
toughened glass used by several PV manufacturers which crazes if
impacted, laminated automobile glass night prove superior (itis already
used in one or two cases for this purpose).Another improvement would be
the use of smaller and more numerous modules; this would nave the
disadvantage of involving more external electrical connections, but a single
breakage would be less serious because the proportion of power loss
would be small and the module would be cheaper to replace. Smaller units
are cheaper to pack and transport and less likely to suffer damage in the
first place. Such an arrangement would also allow more flexibility in the
choice of array voltage-current combinations, giving a better chance of
optimising the system performace more closely for different conditions.
No concentrating solar collector systems were tested during Phase I (none
was available to suit our specitication), but the same observations would
of course apply to systems involving glass mirrors.
There was a lack of concensus by manufacturers as to the correct inclination
for optimum performance from the system. There are problems in
the tropics at equatorial latitudes due to the shallow almost horizontal
positioning that is optimum for solar energy collection, but bad for rainwater
run off and self-cleaning. Here an adjustable array has obvious
benefits, especially if it could be calibrated with recommended positions
for different seasons for the region in question. In addition, some arrays
were too close to the ground, making them prone to collect dust and ah
more likely to be damaged by people or animals.
Wiring presented numerous problems, with badly (or in some cases
wrongly) prepared wiring harnesses, poor instructions and it was often
difficult to connect terminal blocks to connecisn. No detailed analysis
has yet been completed on wire losses, but it is believed these may be
significant in many cases. Blocking diodes were another serious energy
drain in some cases (and in two examples the systems tiere supplied
with some or all diodes connected back to front). If follows that system
arrays should ideally:
0 be adjustable in inclination and azimuth (or be fully portable)
0 have simple foundation requirements allowing for imprecise
positioning with the array held well clear of the ground. Where
loading conditions permit arrays should be fully portable and
should not require any foundations.
0 have clear and simple instructions
55
0 have generous wiriig and effective mechanics! tem:inal grips to
ensure good electrical contact. If possible blccking diodes should
be avoided or be sized for low losses.
One system was supplied with a length of 25mm diameter hosepipe at the
delivery of the pump. If this had not been changed to SOmm, a significant
loss of performance would have resulted due to pipe friction.
Systems with suction centrifugal pumps can incorporate almost
unclearable airlocks in the suction pipe-work due to poor design; one was
partially cured by inverting the pipe and tilling the space where an air
bubble had been. However, this is not the kind of modification that ought
to be required.
Another system was marred by a series of failures of electronic
components in the electric motor commutation and in the power conditioner
due either to overheating or to excessive transient voltages or
currents. The system in question appeared sound in concept, and the
circuits that gave trouble are worth including in the design-if they can be
made reliable. The faults have been corrected but clearly electronic
circuits incorporated in solar pumping systems need to use components
with a tolerance of high ambient temperatures. They will also benefit
from a degree of inbuilt protection from excessive temperature, voltages
or currents which should trip-out the system if it overheats.
Operating voltages were generally around 6OV. Lower voltages are
undesirable, as they require a low-voltage high-current array with
consequent greater resistive line losses, or the need for heavier and more
expensive cabling to compensate. However, d.c. voltages greater than
about 80V present an electrocution hazard (dc is more dangerous than ac)
and for safety reasons are to be avoided; one system tested used 12OV dc,
but it is understood the manufacturer is changing this to a lower voltage.
Hence it appears that systems optimised at about 80V would achieve
the best cost-effectiveness without introducing any serious hazard.
Generally, it seems that there is a need for manufacturers to pay more
attention to detail and to increase the level of quality control, inspection
and pre-despatch testing that seems to have been applied to most of the
systems purchased during the course of the Project.
3.4 llre Importance of Local Manufacture
An important consideration, if small-scale solar pumps are to be used in large
numbers, is their suitability for local manufacture or at least part-manufacture and
local assembly. This is because one of the primary motivating forces in seeking
56
alternatives to sngines for water pumping stems from the high cost of importing
oil and the difficulty many developing countries are having with their balance of
payments due to the oil price increases of recent years. Clearly if solar pumps are
imported, then similar problems arise in finding the foreign currency to pay for
them as for importing oil. However, if a significant proportion of the capital cost
of solar pumps originates within the local economy, then they would be attractive
in terms of import substitution and reduced foreign currency requirements.
Additional bene!i;s trotn local manufacture would be:
0 shorter supply lines from manufacturer to user, resulting in:
*) more accurate system specification to suit local conditions
b) reduced shipping costs
C) minimisation of import formalities, and duties and the costs
of intermediaries
d) more rapid and responsive spare-parts availability and aftersales
service
0 job creation within the local economy
0 enhancement and upgrading of technical skills and capabilities within
the country
0 reduced dependence on imported fuels (and a greater level of national
self-reliance)
0 if lower pumping costs are achieved, then impoved agricultural productivity
and cheaper food may result with allied economic benefit to the
rural population
Therefore, the question of local manufacture or part-manufacture is important
when considering the merits of specific small-scale solar pumping systems for use in
developing countries.
It can be,expected that there will be a number of barriers to the development of
the technology relating to the local manufacture requirement. A key one is that the
large international manufacturers who might be expected to take an initiative in
commercialising the technology are inhibited by a number of factors, such as:-
0 the potential market, although extremely large, consists mainly of poor
farmers lacking capital resources. Therefore even when the technology is
shown to be economic, the eventual market size will be dependant on
intervention by governments and/or agricultural credit banks to set up
suitable financing facilities. The consequent need for independent
assurance is one of the main reasons why the UNDP/World Bank
programme is of such importance.

0 unit costs, which are a key factor in achieving economic viability, are
closely related to the scale of manufacture (particularly for photovoltaic
c&s). A commitment to a large scale of manufacture (a large investment)
or heavy subsidies appear to be essential at an early stage to bring system
costs down.
0 decentralised manufacture within individual developing countries, with
minimised external costs to the local economy, is against the shorter
term commercial interests of many large transnational commerci*l
interests, since such companies would seek a good return in hard currency.
Thus some companies capable of promoting the technology will have
short term constraints which effectively militate against such
development.
0 the engineering industries in developing countries, on the other
hand, generally lack the research and development capability to develop
new products. Sometimes they actually have the capability but simply
lack experience and hence the confidence necessary to embark on
technical innovation. Research institutions, many of which are associated
with universities or government, often have the capabilities but lack
adequate contact with the commercial secmr to convert experimental
prototypes effectively into commercialiy viab!e products.
There is a school of thought that technology that is both technicaUy and economically
feasible will develop in response to market pressures. However, there is no
real evidence that this assumption always holds true -many potentially valuable
inventions have not been exploited and developed. Also technical solutions are
urgently required to the anticipated demand for a future expansion of food
production which demands a strategic rather than an ad hoc approach from
international agencies and governments.
If solar pumps appear to be essential to the improvement of food production, then
resources for their future development may have to be provided from develop
ment funds. There are many pressing demands for such Lids, so any large
investment should not be made until it is clear that solar pumps are more
worthwhile than other types of renewable energy pumping system. It was beyond
the scope of this phase of the Project to make any indepth comparison between
solar and other renewable energy resources for pumping, but it is hoped to look at
this question in future phases.

4.1 Photovolt& Cells
4.1.1 Basic Technology
Converting solar radiation directly to electricity is a comparatively new
technology which grew from the semi-conductor revolution in electronics
of the 1950’s. Photovoltaics were initially extremely expensive for power
applications and their use was restricted to powering space satellites.
However during the late 1960’s, improvements in manufacturing
techniques combined with increased manufacturing volumes led to a
steady decline in their unit cost and they began to be used for premium
terrestrial applications such as powering remote navigational equipment,
telecommunication repeater stations and, more recently, for isolated
equipment such as railway signals and country telephone boxes. There are
now at least 15 manufacturers of silicon solar cells, working in more than
9 countries.
The only type of photovoltaic power cell commercially available so far is
the sillcon cell, usually in the mono-crystalline form but recently also in
polycrystalline form. Before discussing these and their costs in more
detail, it is worth outlining the terminology used.
The mono-crystalline silicon solar ceU itself consists of a thin slice of
highly purified and then chemically doped crystalline silicon (i.e. cut from
a single crystal grown from molten pure silico,r). Modem commercial cells
are generally 1OOmm (4 in) in diameter (some are cut square or hexagonal
to allow closer packing). Metal contacts are applied to the front and rear
surfaces. When exposed to sunlight silicon cells develop a potential of
0.6V (at 250) on open circuit and will deliver around 25mA of current for
each square cm of ceU surface under an irradiance of I kW/ms ., i.e. giving
about 2A from a single IOOmm diameter cell at OSV, which is 1 W power
rating. Cell efticiencies are typically 10 to 12% at present; i.e. a yield of
100 to 12OW can be expected from every square metre of cell area in an
irradian;:ce2 .c :* ‘n-z .”-, :- .3 .. . Poly-crystalline solar cells are similar except the
wafers are cut from cast ignots of pure molten silicon, usually 1OOmm
square in section. Their efficiency is typically about 9 to 10%.
Cells are usually connected in a series “string” (making the cell voltages
additive), the string of cells being built into a “module”. The module is
usually a rectangular panel consisting of a glass (or sometimes plastic)
window and a rigid back with the cells laminated between them. The cells
are generally encapsulated in a suitable polymerised pottant to protect
them from damage. Terminals for the cell string are provided externally
on each module. A set of modules is then built into an “array”, which
generally consists of a frame to carry the modules securely, plus a wiring
harness and junction box to allow the modules to be connected
electrically in a suitable series/parallel combination to suit the load, and to
provide an off-take for their power.

4.1.2 C&S
The cost tigures which follow relate to the large quantity purchase of
modules (i.e. packaged cells) in 1980 US dollars. Power outputs are
germrally given for cells exposed to lkW/ma of sunlight when at a
temperature of 25°C. This is not a realistic operating condition, as they
norm&y run sttbsiantirdly hotte. I than this which results in reduced
performance, but it is an industry standard that coincides with solar cell
testing techniques.
The selling price of silicon PV modules has dropped quite dramatically in
recent years; from S 2OOOjWpk in 19% (when their use for powering
space satellites started), to S 30/Wpk in 1976 (for terrestrial modules),
falling to S 1 l/Wpk in 1979 and to about S 9/Wpk in 1980 (from the
manufacturer with the largest share of the market). Figure 12 illustrates
PV prices since 1976 and some predictions for the future. This diagram is
based on the former US Department of Energy published price goais (e.g.
Ref 25) which are now almost certainly, over optimistic. The Consultants
believe there is some possibility of the price dropping to S7/W pk by
19834 and perhaps 1-2 S/W pk by 1990.
The selling price of solar cells does not necessarily have any close
connection with either production costs or their current economic
competitiveness with other energy resources, since some manufacturers,
particularly in the USA, have been benefiting from the policy of the
American government prior to 1981 of encouraging large scale production
of PV cells through bulk purchases and various financial incentives for
potential end-users. It is widely assumed that some of the lowest selling
prices reflect manufacturers’ strategies of improving their share of the
market and volume of sales by selling “loss leaders” now, with the
expectation of reducing their production costs and seeking profitability
later on. Hence the selling price of PV cells is significantly affected by the
marketing strategies of those manufacturers holding the largest current
share of the market, and the losses some are prepared to accept.
The trend over the last year has been for the price of alar cells to level
off: the lowest prices in 1981, at around S9/Wpk were snnilar to those in
1980, which, allowing for inflation, implies a small decrease in real costs.
The range of prices from different manufacturers has also narrowed.
Changes of policy are being introduced by the new US Administration
which may be causing manufacturers to rethink their pricing policies.
There was a shortfall in the production of so!ar cells in 1980 when the
price reached a low level, possibly due to higher than anticipated demand,
which may have also influenced pricing policy.
Current mono-crystalline silicon cell technology still relies on a
considerable element of hand assembly. It is expected that if there is an
increase in the present market size, automated production will result in a
further growth coupled with, and dependent on, further price drops. The
most expensive item in the production of mono-crystalline silicon solar
cells at present is the pure silicon raw material, currently costing well over
$2/W pk (according to Ref. 27); improved processes, particularly the
development of cheaper solar grade silicon and cast ignot techniques
coupled with increased production should result in continued price
reductions.

It is expected that other PV cell technologies will be commercially used
within the next two years; these include thin film cadmium/copper
sulphide cells and amorphous silicon cells. Both of these are “behind
schedule” if the claims of their adherents made only two or three years
ago were believed; but there is good reason to believe that some of the
technical problems facing these technologies are being overcome and that
they may well be competitive with crystalline silicon, but probably not
until the end of the decade. In theory, thin film cells of these kinds could
become significantly cheaper than crystalline silicon, once a high volume
of production is achieved, so the price levels predicted in Figure 1’2 for the
cad of the decadr nii ,,;L:-.
Although it appears that PV cells are still too expensive to allow solar
pumps to be viable for irrigation, a further price reduction of 50% would
make them potentially useful under carefully chosen conditions, while a
60-70% reduction would probably make them economically viable for
very low head pumping (around 3m).
Also, they probably are already viable for certain water supply duties in
remote areas at moderate or low heads, but it was beyond the scope of
the first phase of this Project to investigate this application.
4.2 Existing Photovoltaic Pumping Installations
Unlike solar-thermal power systems, photovoltaics are now being widely installed
in practical and economically viable applications, notably for remote telecommunications
systems.
There are currently at least 60 small photovoltaic water pumps in operation around
the World. Most of these are being used for demonstration purposes and probably
only those systems used for water supplies are economically viable as yet. The
majority of these have been installed by the French company Pompes Guinard
and the US company Solar Electric International (SEI). They all use flat plate
silicon solar cell arrays but the type of motor/pump set and control system varies
between the manufacturers and particular applications. Table 7 presents details of
some existing installations.
4,3 Photovoltaic Pumping Systems
The main components of a photovoltaic pumping system are illustrated schematically
in Figure 13. Components indicated in solid outlined boxes are essential to
any photovoltaic system, whereas the components indicated within broken line
boxes are options that have been offered by some but not all system supplien. The
energy flows (and losses) through a basic PV solar pumping system are shown in

4.4 Photovoltaic Amy
4.4.1 Monwrystalline Silicon Arrays
The key component of any photovoltaic system is the array, which
converts sunlight directly to direct-current electricity.
The basic element is the solar cell, of which there are several types.
However, the only type commercially available at present is the monocrystalline
silicon cell, which has the considerable advantage of being
based on well-known semi-conductor technology. Its mode of operation is
well understood and it has been manufactured in large quantities. One
version is shown in Figure 14, consisting of a thin slice of specially-doped
single-crystal silicon, commonly 50mm to !3Pmm in diameter or, more
recently, square, with metal contacts on the front and back surfaces. The
surface is often treated so as to minimise the amount of light reflected
and thereby improve the efficiency.
Figure 15 shows the voltage-current and voltage-power characteristics of a
modem silicon ceU at 2SoC in sunlight at an irradiance of 1000W/m2 -
the so-called “peak” conditions. The short-circuit current (at zero voltage)
is directly proportional to the cell area and the irradiance, while the opencircuit
voltage (at zero current) is independent of cell area and is logarithmically
related to the irradiance. The maximum power delivered is rep
resented by the area of the Largest rectangle than can be fitted under
the curve (being the product of voltage and current). In this case, maximum
power of 12.7mW/cm2 is produced at a voltage of just under
OSV. The maximum conversion efficiency is the maximum output power
expressed as a percentage of the input power @radiance x cell area), in
this case 12.7%. However, if the cell is operated at voltages away from
about 0.45V. the power and the efficiency decline to zero at 0 or 0.6
V.
The maximum operating voltage is normally fixed so as to be slightly less
than the voltage for maximum power; i.e. just to the left of the “knee”
of the curve. It should be noted that the current from a good cell is almost
constant over the voltage range up to the operating point.
Ar. increase in cell temperature causes a slight rise in short-circuit current
Is, but a sharp fall in open-circuit voltage V,,, as shown on Figure 16. As
a result the maximum power and efficiency fall by abwt 0.5% per degree
c rise.
Because of the loss of power at high temperatures, it is important in array
design and installation to ensure that the cells run at as low a temperature
as possible.
Figure 17 shows the effect of a temperature rise from 25OC to 60°C on
the voltage-current characteristic. The voltage for maximum power also
falls with increasing temperature. However, providing the cell operating
temoerature does not exceed that corresponding to the voltage for
ma&mum power at the highest operational temperature, the output
current is only slightly affected by changes of temperzture.

Figure 18 shows how the characteristic changes in cloudy conditions,
when the iradiance might fail to 200W/mr. Power at the operating
voltage faiis roughly in proportion to the irradiance but is still available at
this voltage down to a very low light threshold. This is an important
feature of photovoltaics. in concentrated sunlight, the short-circuit
current increases proportionally to the itradiance up to extremely high
levels (providing the cell temperature is kept constant) and the
open-circuit voltage increases logarithmically, so one might expect the
conversion efficiency to in- .,.ove. in practice, however, the series
resistance of the ceU has a progressively flattening effect on the
voltage-current characteristic, so higher efficiencies are not achieved unless
steps are taken in the ceU design to reduce series resistance. This feature
and the provision of adequate cooling are the main technological problems
in developing ceiis for high concentration.
Silicon solar ce!is, in contrast to thermal collectors, respond very
rapidly to changes of h-radiance, their time constant being about 20
microsecond.
The photovoltaic module, the basic building block of a Uat plate array,
consists of a number of interconnected ceils, usually in a single series
string, encapsulated behind a transparent window to protect the fragile
cells from mechanical damage and the weather. The number of cells in
series is chosen to ensure that the module will produce power at the
desired working voltage at the highest expected operational temperature.
in most commercial designs, an element of redundancy is introduced in
the inter-connections between cells so that a single broken or bad
connection does not cause a complete failure of the module.
To achieve the long working life that is required, the module must be
rugged, capable of resisting ultra-violet radiation, thermal cycling, thermal
shock, moisture ingress, fungi growth, sand, dust, hail, salt spray, wind
loading, wind-induced vibrations and rough handling. A number of special
hazards are also likely in the environment expected for irrigation systems,
for example obscuration and damage by bird guano and damage by
aninials (goats have even been reported trying to eat the encapsulant),
plus the possibility of theft or vandalism.
Glass is usually used as a window material in current designs and synthetic
resins such as silicon rubber or poiyvhryibutyrai (PVB) as encapsuiants.
However, the Consultants’ experience in the field trials has shown glass to
be vuhrerabie to breakage, both in transit and on site. Polymer&d resins
and polycarbonate plastics have been used in the past, but proved to be
excessively pervious to moisture and prone to deterioration from dust.
Possibly a laminated glass and plastic window cover would offer the
virtues of both materials without their disadvantages.
As a certain amount of space has to be allowed between the ceils, the conversion
efficiency of a module, based on the gross irea it occupies in an
array, is less than that of individual ceils. Figures for commercialiyavailable
modules range at present from 5 to 8% for those embodying
circular ceiis and 8 to 11% for those with square ceils. The trend is to
70
increase the packing density of modties by using squared off cells in order
to reduce the size and the cost of modules of a given power rating. In
general, PV array efficiencies are quoted as a function of complete
array area rather than ceU area, and su pplier and designers should always
be careful to defme efficiencies in quoted specifications.
Modules are rated in terms of “peak power”, that is to say, the power
they should pmduce at a specified working voltage and temperature
(usually 25oC) in sunlight at an it-radiance of lOOOW/ms Because of the
diurnal cycle and variations in atmospheric attenuation due to weather
conditions, the average output is considerably less than the rated peak
value. For instance in some parts of India, Australia, the Middle East
and Africa, where the mean global hradiance averaged over 24 hours is
250W/ma, a module rated at 10 peak watts could in theory produce 2.5W
on average, or 60Wh/day. However in practice the operating temperature
will be higher than 25OC and wili result in a reduction of output of
typically 7’S% at 40°C. in addition, attenuating effects due to dirt
accumulation and ageing of the encapsulation and window surface may
further reduce output by 5 to 10%. Hence a module rated at 1OW peak
may only yield say 50Wh/day rather than the 60W:l/day predicted on the
basis of ideal power ratings.
The above analysis assumes that the module is always loaded electrically
so as to make it operate at, (or near to) its maximum power and
maximum efficiency point. Failure to do this would reduce the daily
output further.
A further problem with PV atrays is bad matching of either modules or
cells. inconsistent manufacturing can cause the characteristics of
individual cells to vary. A sub-standard ceil or module in a series string
may, under certain load conditions, be driven into reverse bias, causing
power to be dissipated in the affected element. in extreme cases this
can cause over heating and eventual failure. A similar effect can be caused
by a fault such as a cracked ceil or by the shadowing of certain ceils or
modules.
With badly-matched modules in parallel, certain load conditions can cause
a reverse current to flow through modules with low open circuit voltage,
*gdrii i*usL1; >Z”=-;- 1<-.- .LL -- 7.A >il<;y&..,..edcd_ .
Therefore manufacturers are trying to improve the consistency of their
products and to identify modules with slight variations so that they can
be matched with similar ones when assembling an array. it is possible that,
in future, mass production wiU result in more consistent products from
the industry than at present.
Field experience with photovoltaic arrays in a variety of applications
extends over a number of years. One French installation powering a
copper electrolysis plant in Chile has been working satisfactorily for 20
years and photovoitaics have been used for educational TV in Niger over
the past 10 years. in general, the arrays have functioned with a high
degree of reliability and a life of 20 years seems a reasonable goal.
CIaims to have achieved this goal already with currently manufactured
modules are based on projections from accelerated ageing tests rather than
on real experience.
During the laboratory tests conducted in Phase I of the Project, it was
found that although the modules tested were adequately reliable in that
they almost all sunrived the testing programme, they ah had a number of
manufacturing defects. Most of these were minor, but a few were
potentially serious. There was some variability in the performance of the
modules tested and most of the outputs and efficiencies were below their
manufacturers’ specification by from 2.5% to 16.5%.
Clearly, the great virtue of flat plate photovoltaic arrays is their ability
to generate electricity from the sunlight without moving mechanical parts.
The resulting reliability and ease of maintenance will be important considerations
in the preserrt application.
The present high cost of photovoltaic arrays is mainly due to the
expensive single crystal silicon and the use of labour-intensive batch production
methods in the fabrication of cells and modules. However,
extensive efforts are being made to reduce the cost of the starting material
and to develop automated production processes as the market expands.
The US Department of Energy had agreed to belo fund a $6M plant which
will use Union Carbide’s silane process to produce about 10: tooF.?s of
pure silicon per year and which, it is claimed, should bring the cost of
silicon suitable for photovoltaic cells down from well c~;si $2.00 to
around SO.50 per peak: watt. Other approaches to cheaper silicon are the
heat exchanger method (HEM) being developed by Crystal Systems, USA,
cast polycrystalline ingots (Solarex, USA, and Wacker Chemitronic, West
Germany), continuous ribbon growth (Mobil-Tyco, USA, and Japan Solar
Energy Co., Toshiba 2nd Toyo Silicon Co., Japan), dendritic web silicon
(Westinghouse, USA), zone growth by laser beam melting (Motorola,
USA), and sheet growth on low-cost substrates (LEP, France and others).
The Stanford Research Institute is also understood to have achieved a
breakthrough by purifying silicon in one step instead of two, thereby
reducing the cost of pure silicon from $60/kg to under S lo/kg.
4.4.2 Other Types of Photovoltaic Cells under Development
Another approach to cost reduction is to replace the silicon ceU by
a potentially cheaper type. The main contenders are as follows:
(a) Cuprous Sulphide/Cadmium Sulphide
This solar cell consists of a p-n junction between two different
semiconductors: n-type cadmium sulphide and p-type cuprous
sulphide, most of the light being absorbed by the latter. In the
“backwall” type, the tight enters through the cadmium sulphide,
which is deposited on a transparent substrate. In the more
common “frontwall” type, the cuprous sulphide layer is illumin72
ated. Figure 19 shows the cross-section of a typical frontwall
thin-film cell, which was originaily developed for space
applications and is now being adapted for terrestrial use.
This cell is potentially cheaper to make than mono-crystalline
silicon types and its manufacturing processes are adaptable to
mass production. tiui ii is not so well ur,dsrstood and its
technology not so well advanced, despite the large sum of money
spent on its development in USA, France and other countries.
Efficiencies have not advanced beyond the 9% mark and are
commonly below 6%. The theo:e:ica! maximum has been
estimated to lie between 11 and 14%. Cu2S/CdS cells are not
yet as stable or as reproducible as silicon cells. The main cause of
degradation is the oxidation of the cuprous sulphide to the less
efficient cupric sulphide. To prevent this, hermetic encapsulation
must be employed. Pilot production lines have been set up in
USA by SES Inc. (frontwall) and Photon Power (backwall on
glass) but neither company has yet been able to offer modules on
the market, although SES Inc. claim that they are close to
commercialisation. Despite the difficulties, there is still a
considerable body of opinion which regards this type as the
main contender in the search for a really cheap solar cell.
(b) Schottky Barrier
A metal/semiconductor junction (Schottky barrier) has photovoltaic
properties similar to those of a p-n junction and solar cells
embodying such junctions can theoretically be made as efficient.
This type is suitable for low-cost mass production. The metal can
be either in the form of a substrate supporting a thin film of
polycrystalline or amorphous semiconductor material or a thin
transparent layer over the semiconductor. The cross-s&ion in
Figure 20 shows the essential features of the latter version.
Research on Schottky barrier cells is in the early stages at
present, although an efficiency of 11.7% has been reported with
single crystal silicon as the semiconductor and a possible 15%
with gallium arsenide. A key factor, and one that it is proving
difficult to control, is the thin oxide layer which it has been
found necessary to interpose between the metal and
semiconductor to raise the open-circuit voltage to an acceptable
level. Because of this insulating layer, some investigators are
applying the term “MIS” (metal-insulator-semiconductor) or
“AMOS” (anti-reflectivemetal-oxide-semiconductor) to this
type of cell. The operation of Schottky barrier cells is not yet
well understood.
Cc) Amorphous Silicon
The optical properties of thin films of hydrogenated amorphous
silicon are such that it should be possible to make efficient solar
cell from a thickness of only 1 or 2 ,um. Since crystalline si!icon
Cek require 300 to 400 @m, this represents a dramatic saving in

material. Both homojunction and Schottky barrier cells are being
developed with amorphous silicon but the work is in its early
stages and many problems remain to be overcome. Best
performance to date was achieved by RCA, who made a
Schottky barrier cell with an efficiency of 5.5%.
Cd) Gallium Arsenide
The modem gallium arsenide ceU consists of a thin epitaxial
layer of gallium auuminium arsenide super-imposed on thin
epitaxial layers of p and n-type galllum arsenide, all on a
substrate of single crystal gallium arsenide. Figure 2! shows the
construction in cross-section. Its main attraction lies in its ability
to operate efficiently in highly-concentrated sunlight, which
opens up possibilities for off-setting its cost, which is much
higher than that of silicon and likely to remain so. Cells have
been operated at concentrations of up to 5000 suns although a
more practical limit is 2000. Efficiencies of over 20% have been
claimed. However, production has been only on a laboratory
scale so far.
4.4.3 Concentrating photovoltaic arrays
Photocells arr perhaps the most expr.*,ne >Anglee lement in a PV pumping
system. Sir-e their output can be b ,osted simply by increasing the
intensity of illumination, it is possible to reduce the area of cells necessary
for a given power output (and their cost) by concentrating sunlight onto
them. Reduced overall costs have been claimed for this because the extra
sunlight concentrating equipment can cost less than the extra number
of cells that would be needed to provide the same output without
concentration.
Methods of concentrating the sunlight that are commonly used include
focussing mirrors or using Fresnel lenses (usually moulded in plastic).
Figure 22 shows the principal methods schematically; the cells can be
between or surrounded by reflecting surfaces (top diagram), at the focus
of a parabolic reflector, facing away from the sun towards the reflector
(centre diagram), or behind a lens, at its focus, (lower diagram). In the
latter case a Fresnel lens is usuaUy used as this can be kept quite thin and
light in weight and can be mass produced cheaply from clear plastic. By
contrast, a normal convex lens would have to be very large and expensive
for the apertures involved.
Figure 22 is only two dimensional. In practice any of the concentrating
systems shown can be either point focussing or line focussing. In the
former case the reflector or Fresnel lens is normally circular (or
polygonal) in aperture with the PV cells on its central axis. In the latter
case the cross sections illustrated would extend linearly with the cells
mounted as indicated as a long narrow strip. The degree of concentration
is related to the ratio of the aperture and the area of cells at its focus;
so-called “point” focussing results geaerally in a higher concentration
factor, the image being small in area rather than a point.

Although concentrating systems might save on cell costs, they have a
number of disadvantages, which are as follows:-
(a) Concentrating the sunlight causes the cells to heat up (to potentiaiiy
very high temperatures at high concentration ratios)
and hence cooling of the celis becomes necessary. This can be
done passively using air cooled fms as a heat sink (as illustrated)
for low concentration ratios, but water cooling is usually
necessary for high ratios. Any faihue of the cooling could result
in destruction of ihe expensive cells.
(b) Most types of concentrators need to be tracked in order to keep
them correctly aligned with the sun. The higher the
concentration ratio, the more accurately must they be tracked;
(some very low concentration ratio systems need only be tracked
very occasionally suet as every few weeks to cater for seasonal
changes in the sun’s course across the sky). Tracking introduces
complication in the form of a mechanism (clockwork, electrical,
or powered by solar-heated vapour) and it not only requires the
array to move readily in response to the tracker, but also to be
rigidly located so as to resist any movement due to wind gusts;
hence an expensive support structure may be needed.
(cl Concentrators can only focus direct beam radiation from the sun,
so the diffuse component cannot be used. Therefore
concentrators are only likely to be effective in areas with arid
climates having a large proportion of direct sunshine with limited
haze and cloud. In comparison with fixed flat-plate colhsctors,
tbis shortcoming is partially compensated for by the fact that
in tracking the sun more energy can be collected, as described
in section 2.7 and illustrated in Figures 4A and 48.
(d) Uneven iRumination of the celis is a problem, particciark~ with
low concentration ratio systems when celi strings s;c >I parallel
as well as in series, as this can cause internally ~ircuiating currents
and “hot spots”. Uneven illumination can be caused by blemishes
or discontinuities in the reflector(s), or by a non-continuously
tracked system being misaligned with the incoming beam
radiation.
(e) Reflectors (or lenses) involve a loss due to imperfect reflectivity
(or transmissivity); this is at least 10% of the energy flux per
reflection (or transmission) and possibly substantially more. A
major problem with reflectors, panictiilariy in arid areas where
the high proportion of direct to diffuse radiation is to be found,
is degradation, either temporarily or permanently, due to dust
collecting on the reflecting surfaces. With flat plate arrays this is
less of a prob!em as although the dust scatters the light, much of
it still is received by the cehs.
When being compared to a Rat photovoltaic array, a concentrating wray
with its associated tracking system can only be justified if the cost sa+ng
from using fewer solar cells ourweighs the extra cost and complication of
77
tracking, account being taken of the extra energy gained by tracking and
the energy lost through inability to utilise the diffuse component. It
should be t.orne in mind that flat-plate arrays can benefit considerably
from occasonal tracking, but do not need the expense and complication
of continuous tracking. The benefits expected from this and other options
are illustrated by Figures 5A and ZB and are quantified later in this
chapter.
As the cost of PV cells falls, the balance should move in favour of nonconcentrating
arrays, especially for small systems. Present lowest costs per
peak watt .:laimed by manufacturers are similar for concentrating and
non-concentrating arrays This suggests that if the price of PV cells falls
substantially (which it must do if solar irrigation pumping is to become
viable) then, since the price of mirror reflectors and tracking ;. unlikely to
fall as math az the price of cells, it seems unlikely that concentrating
systems will prove competitive ln the long run.
There are two configurations which might prove to be cost effective.
0 very low concentration by adding small reflectors to the
periphery of a llat plate array might well be cost-effective due to
the simplicity of such an arrangement and rhe fact that tracking
would not be necessary and much of the diffuse component
would still be useful. This implies a reflector area probably
less than that of the cells, simply used as a booster.
0 it is possible that systems with very high concentration ratios
might be cost-effect&e through being able to use rather small
areas of high cost but high efficiency photovoltaics (such as, for
example, gallium arsenide) which would in turn possibly allow a
significant reduction in the array aperture required for a given
electrical power output. This would be likely to be cost-effective
only if substantial gains in celt efficiency prove possible due,
to the various concentrator losses they must outweigh. However,
if gross array efficiencies o: over 20% or so prove possible
through this approach, it would probably be worthy of serious
consideration.
As discussed in Chapter 2, the sizing of a small-scale irrigation pump is
critically dependent on the peak irrigation water demand and the solar
energy availability in that month -for most months the system will be
oversized for the actual water needs. Therefore, manual tracking of the
array may be important to minimise this mismatch, since careful tracking
during times of peak water demand will go some way towards reducing
the required system size and cost while at other times of the year less
careful or no tracking may be adequate.
It is open to question whether the extra costs and continuous complication
of mechanical automatic tracking systems will be justified,
when the benefits will probably only be necessary in the irrigation
application during the one month of maximum irrigation water demand.
Further investigation of automatic tracking system costs nnd the actual
capabilities of farmers at manual tracking will be essenr~l to clarify this
iSSW.

4.5 ElectricMotors
Most system suppliers at present favour dc permanent magnet motors. This type
of motor, although more expensive than field wound dc motors, offers such a good
efficiency, particularly under part-load conditions, that it is virtually the only
sensible option.
As described in the Pro+ct Report, most of the motors tested were conventional
with a segmented commutator and brushes. Such machines generally require new
brushes at intervals of the order of 2000 - 4000 hours, and if this is not done,
certain models can suffer irreparable damage. Some dc motors are being offered
with claimed brush lies of about 10000 hours, and these would be better for this
kind of application if these lives were acbievTedu nder Reid conditions. With any
brushed machine, fail-safe brush design is essential, so that the machine will stop
once the brushes are too worn. rather than damage itself. No investigation of actual
brush life was possible under Phase I of the Project. Another problem with brushed
motors is the build up of carbon dust that arises from wear of the brushes, which
can cause arcing or overheating of the armature or premature wear of the bearings.
An alternative type of permanent magnet motor (one of which was tested during
the fmt phase of this Project) is brushless with the magnets in the rotor and an
electronically commutated stator. In principle, such machines seem more attractive
than brushed machines for small-scale solar pumping, since their only wearing parts
are the bearings and any seals. However, although early problems with the
electronics have been corrected, the electronic circuiting is still vulnerable to overheating
due to the high temperatures that can be reached when the motor runs for
long periods, especially in the tropics. Thus they need effective protection from
damage by high current or voltage transients, from external damage (eg by
humidity), and from overheating through good heat sink design.
The electronically commutated motor which was tested was slightly less efficient
than the best of the brushed dc machines tested. It is likely that the higher power
drain from the electronic commutator is inherently the reason for lower efficiency
although electronically commutated motors could probably be built which show a
less marked drop in efficiency compared with the best brushed machines. Brushes
are a source of energy loss due to the resistive losses they imply and due to friction
with the commutator surface, all of which can be set against the electronic
commutation circuit’s parasitic power dram. However, a higher efficiency electronically-
commutated motor is likely to cost more to manufacture.
The laboratory testing programme completed during the Phase I of the Project
indicated that the better dc permanent magnet motors, in the 250 to SOOWra nge
are capable of optimum efficiencies of around 85% and even at half load their
effciencies should exceed 75%. A more detailed description of the testing
programme is included in the companion Project Report, but Figure 23 indicates a
typical dc permanent magnet motor characteristic obtained during the testing
programme. Some of the poorer electric motors were only 75 - 80% efficient.
However it is worth noting that an 85% efficient motor requires 9% less array
area than one of say 78% efficiency - with a typical 400W array this translates into
a capital cost saving at the array of typically one 36W module, worth about 6360
at present day prices.

Mass produced ac motors are about half as efficient as dc permanent magnet
motors in the small power sizes of interest. In addition, they require the use of an
mverter (to convert dc to ac) and, usually, a battery too, both of which imply
further losses in effkiency. They are generally inefticient as they were not designed
with efficiency as a high priority, (the costs of the electricity used in mains
applications for fractional horspower motors are small) and low unit costs are the
main preoccupation of manufacturers of such equipment. Therefore, although they
might be half the cost of a dc permanent magnet motor of the same power rating,
the lower efticiency will considerably outweigh this benefit I hrough the increased
array size required.
A linear actuator was also tested - this is a reciprocating solenoid device, with
permanent magnets, but brushless. The assumption was that this might be both
efficient, low in cost and simple if coupled directly to a reciprocating pump. !.ack
of a suitable pump hampered this part of the programme as it became clear that
any pump wouid have to be carefully matched to the actuator so as to achieve a
good efficiency at the frequency of vibration used by the actuatcr. The actuator
was designed to operate from 50Hz ac supplies; therefore an inverter or other
switching devices would be required to generate a suitable ac current from the dc
output of an array. Further investigation might be justified since devices of this
kind should be inexpensive and long-lasting a!thougb it is not clear whether good
efticiency can be achieved in practice from an actuator-pump combination,
The main advantage Of using a battery storage in the system, regardless of whether
it delivers current via an inverter to an ac motor or direct to a dc motor, is that it
can provide a steady electrical output even if the photovoltaic array output
tkctuates considerably due to the continuous variation of angle of received
radiation and to passing clouds. It also offers a reserve of power to provide the
surge of current needed to start most electric motors and pumps, a particularly
useful feature if the pump has a high breakway torque, such as with some positive
displacement pumps.
In virtuakly all cases a control system is necessary to regulate the battery charging
process and to switch on the motor/pump combination when the battery stateofeharge
is adequate and to switch it off when the charge level falls too low.
Batteries however involve a number of significant disadvantages, namely:
0 they are an expensive component;
0 they getter& need regular topping up with distilled water (sealed
mamtenance-free batteries are availabie, but are considerabiy more
expensive).
they give rise to a significant energy loss as the charge-discharge cycle will
generally be in the range 50 to 80% efficient, which necessitates a larger
photovoltaic array; and
81
0 the life of conventional lead/acid batteries is limited to about 5 years
under field conditions, considerably less than the desirable life of the
system as a whole.
It is worth noting that the principal photovoltaic system manufacturers, with
experience of solar pumping in developing countries, offer systems without
batteries, the dc motors being powered directly from the photovoltaic array. It is
not expected that batteries are likely to be cost-effective for sma&scaIe solar
pumping systems used for irrigation at low heads, where the pumps need not have a
high starting torque.
4.7 Pomps
4.7.1 GeneraI
In the Consultants’ view, an essential requirement for any solar pumping
system is the use of a pump that will reliably self-prime, even if the
foot-valve (where fitted) is imperfect. A large proportion of the low head
systems currently commercially available do not meet this requirement.
The self-priming requirement narrows the choice to:
0 submersible centrifugal combined motor/pump units.
0 a centrifugal sump-pump arrangement, with the pump below
water, driven by a shaft from a motor above the water
0 self-priming surface-suction centrifugal pumps, with a priming
reservoir to keep the impeller and casing flooded even in the
event of foot-valve failure.
0 positive-displacement pumps which are inherently self-priming,
(eg. piston, plunger, diaphragm or progressive cavity)
However, for the low heads that are appropriate for small-scale irrigation
positive displacement pumps seem inappropriate on grounds of efficiency,
size and hence cost.
4.7.2 Centrifugal pumps
The conclusions from Phase I of the Project were that a simple single-stage
centrifugal pdmp appears to have the merit of adequate performance
potential combmed with compactness and simplicity as well as having low
starting torque requirements. Centrifugal pumps also offer the possibility
of achieving a close natural match with a PV array (without recourse to
power conditioning) over a broad selection of operating conditions. The
importance of power conditioning is explained later under the section on
PV System Design.

An interesting example of rotodynamic pump is the regenerative
centrit?@, sometimes known as a side-chamber pump. In this pump, the
water makes more than one transit through the impeller by being
redirected back into the impeller by passagesin the casing. The entire
inplIer does not therefore run full and losses due to water leaking back
from the high pressure to the low pressure end are reduced through
maintaining smaU cleuances between the impeller and its casing. It has the
advantage of being iolerant of considerable speed reduction, and like most
cent&i@ pomps, it ought to have low starting torque requirements. It
can also tolerate a wide variation in head compared witb most centrifugal
pumpr A performance characteristic for a pump of this type is shown in
Fii 26. However, the example tested was of poor efficiency compared
with the better centrifugaI pomps and was prone to suffer from binding
between the impeller and its casing due to the small clearances. It seems
Iikely that these disadvantages are inherent in this type of pump and may
make it unsuitable for solar pumping systems where high efficiency is
important. Also there is often a need to pump water containing suspended
solids, which makes smaU clearances a serious disadvantage.
4.7.3 Positive Displacement Pumps
Positive displacement pumps can be more efficient than centrifugal
pumps, but generally only at higher heads. The characteristic of a typical
example is shown in Figure 27, which illustrates some of the differences.
It has vertical, rather than horizontal constant speed lines, because flow
with a positive displacement pump is essentially a function of speed
(whereas head is a function of speed squared with a centrifugal pump).
IncreasIng the head with the positive displacement piston pump increases
the power demand and the efficiency, because frictional forces become
smaller relative to the hydrostatic forces at higher heads. Since Phase I of
this Project was only concerned with low head pumping, positive dir
placement pumps under optimum conditions of heads in excess of I Sm.
were not tested.
Therefore, positive displacement pumps of this kind are unlikely to be of
much relevance for irrigation applications, but may have an important role
for solar water supply pumps.
One type of positive displacement pump is the surface suction pump. A
problem associated with this pump is that it can only be used down a large
diameter weU (on suitable supporting steelwork), or in situations where it
can be located within about 5 or 6m of the water level.
An example of a borehole positive displacement pump, which can operate
submerged with zero suction lift is the progressive cavity pump. This type
of pump is one of the commercially-available rotary positive displacement
pomps and has a good reputation for its tolerance of aggressive fluids (be
they abrasive suspensions or chemically corrosive) due to its rubber stator.
Figore 28 illustrates the characteristic of an example of this type of pump,
although the particular model tested was not adequately efficient for
heads of less than 1511 to compete with centrifugal pumps, but may well
be suitable for use with solar water supply pumps sopplied from
boreholes.
“‘,” :’
09
Pump efftciency is critical to the cost-effectiveness of the system and
high efficiencies require good design with such small pumps. The indications
from OUTte st pmgrammes are that an optimum pump efficiency for
smaU pomps (200 to SOOW shaft power requirement) for use at low heads
(in the 5 to IOm range), of around 55% is realisable and that consistent
efficiency of over 45% at reduced speeds or non-optimum heads should
also be achieved. Some systems tested had pumps only half as efficient as
this, which effectively doubles the cost of water from them.
What is not yet known with any certainty is the trade-off between high
efficiency and the need for an impeller with a long life and a good
tolerance of aggressive impurities in the water; good efficiency CM be
obtained with narrow passagesa nd small clearancesw hich are of Course
undesirable. Siarly, good efficiency can also be bought with a high
speed impeller, which is again counterproductive from the point of view
of achieving the longest possible operating life and generous water passage
dimensions. Further longer term investigation of pump durability will be
necessary to arrive at conlident conclusions on the likely performance
Limits that might reasonably be expected.
A typical pump performance characteristic produced during the Project
test programme is given in Figure 24. The sensitivity of this kind of pump
to variations in head is clearly shown by the efticiency contours in the
diagram. This particular pump, which was one of the inure efficient ones
tested, was unusual in having quite steeply sloping constant speed contour
curves, implying that it is tolerant of a significant percentage reduction in
speed before it ceases to deliver water at a given head. Most of the pumps
tested had flatter speed contours more like the one whose characteristic is
shown in Figure 25. Flat speed curves, imply that a small percentage speed
reduction will cause delivery of water to cease. However this was one of
the most efficient small centrifugal pumps tested, achieving over 24%
efficiency at a remarkably low rotational speed.
Off-the-shelf industrial centrifugal pumps, as are commonly used for
smail-scale solar pumping systems at present, are generally designed for
single speed operation when driven by mains electric motors and hence
many are intolerant of any significant speed reduction below the speed for
OptimUm efficiency. Purpose-designed pumps for small-scale solar
pumping will no doubt allow significant improvements to be obtained
which will be measurable in terms of array size reduction through
improved efficiency, as well as greater tolerance of speed and head
variation.
Because pomps are less efficient than motors, a ten per cent absolute
improvement in a pump from 40% to 50% efficiency results in a 25%
reduction in array costs. At present array costs, a one per cent marginal
change in pump efficiency, (with good pumps in the 40 - SO% efticiency
level), would be worth $40 for a 200W (electrical) system and $80 for a
400W system in array savings.
90
One other generic type of pump tested was the free-diaphragm pump
whose characteristics are illustrated in Figure 29. There was some hope at
the outset of the testing programmes that diaphragm pumps might,
through low internal friction, prove a superior type of positive
displacement pump for low head applications. In the event, this particular
type proved not to be competitive with the better centrifugals, although
testing of one example of one type of pump genre cannot be conclusive.
The reason for the lower efficiency than expected is not clear on the basis
of the limited testing so far completed, and the original hypothesis has not
been totally disaproved.
The most weU known type of positive displacement pump was also tested
-this was in the recipmcating piston pump or “bucket” pump of the kind
commonly used as a hand pump. These are well understood and widely
applied in agricultural applications, common examples being hand, diesel,
electric or wind powered via suitable transmission systems to reduce the
input power source to a reciprocating drive in the range 50 to 100 strokes
per minute, or sometimes more. However they are not efficient at heads
much below 10 or 2Om and therefore of little interest for irrigation duties.
4.7.4 Importance of Minimising Pipe Losses
The system design study (see section 4.9) confvmed that lack of care in
specifying the delivery pipework associated with the pump can seriously
affect system efficiency, particularly with low static heads. This is
particularly important in situations where a long pipe is involved. Relevant
points are discussed in section 4.12.
4.8 Meehenical Tmnsmiasions
Since Phase I of the Project was concerned with low head pumping, transmission
systems were not considered in detail. A few general points are reviewed below.
Most centrifugal pumps will be direct coupled to a motor, either by a long shaft, or
in the case of surface-suction pumps and integrated submersible motor-pump units,
close coupled. This is because the speed requirements for economica! motors
and for economical centrifugal pumps are similar, i.e. typically in the 2000 to 3000
rpm range.
With direct-coupled pumps, it is advantageous (except with integrated motorpump
units) if both motor and pump have completely independent shafts and
bearings, (i.e. 2 bearings each) and if the coupling is flexib!e to allow for a
certain degree of misalignment; otherwise premature bearing wear can be expected.
Most positive displacement pumps run at much lower speeds than motors (piston
pumps typically at 50 to 150 strokes/minute) and a speed reducing transmission is
necessary. But, as already explained, this type of pump is likely to be used for
higher head pumping duties than would be appropriate for irrigation.
91
A crlticsl requirement from any transmission is that it should have high efficiency
as weU as the necessary robustness and long life required from a solar pumping
system. Possibilities for such duties inciude belts and pulleys (preferably poly-vee
or toothed, although the latter can transmit damaging torsionai shocks from a reciprocating
pump). Various types of gear box and low speed pitman drives would be
appropriate for use with slow-speed reciprocating pumps located in deep boreholes.
Photovohic Pumping System Optimisntion
The characteristics of PV cells and arrays have been described earlier in section 4.4
To recapitulate; the characteristic of a PV array (such as illustrated in Figures 15,
17 and 18) is unique at a given b-radiance level and array temperature. This is
further lllustoated by Figures 30a and b.
As shown in Figure 15, the maximum efficiency of a ceU, or of an array of cells,
occurs for the values of I and V on the characteristic such that the product of 1
and V is maxhnised. Since the product of I and V for any given point on the I-V
curve is a rectangle of sides I by V, the maximum power point on the curve is that
which produces a rectangle with the largest area capable of fitting within the curve
and it will therefore be on the “knee” of the curve. Clearly it is important to
operate any PV system so as to draw a current such that the array will operate at or
close to its maximum power point.
Figure 30a shows the maximum power point for three irradiance levels (500,750
and lOOOW/sq.m.) at a temperature of 40°C. A curve m-m can be drawn through
these points which is the locus of the maximum power points (or maximum
efficiency points) for that tempershire. It can be inferred from~ Figure 30b that
changes in temperature will tend to move the m-m locus slightly from side to side.
The I and V values for the PV subsystem, or load, at any given instant must be the
same as those for the array, so the actual I-V values that will occur for a given
irrsdiance level depend on the impedance of the electrical load. (Impedance can be
quantified as the ratio of V/I; with purely resistive loads, the impedance equals the
resistance, measured in ohms if V is in volts and I in amps). If the impedance is
very high, such as on open circuit, I will be zero and V will be V,, (i.e. the point
at which the I-V characteristic cuts the V axis) and if the impedance is very
low, such as a short-circuit, V will be essentially zero and I will be Isc, (where the
characteristic cuts the I axis). Figure 15 shows that the power output and hence
the efticiency is effectively zero under the two extreme conditions mentioned.
In order to maximise the output (and the efficiency) of the system under all
operating levels of irradiance, the load should be such that its impedance should
vary to coincide as closely as possible with the I-V ratios represented by the
maximum power point locus m-m in Figure 30a. In practice, it is common for the
load to be correctly matched for just one level of irradiance, such as say lOOOW/
m, but for the subsystem power demand at lower levels of b-radiance to cause
the array to operate further and further from optimum such as illustrated by locii
m, - m2 or m2 - m2 in Figure 30a.
Figure 3Oc shows that, up to the maximum levels of voltage and current the
motor can safeby bear, there are unique values of torque and speed corresponding
to any unique value of voltage and current. If the array characteristic is super92

imposed on the motor I-V plane, it generates a unique set of speed and torque
values, as does the maximum power point locus m-m. i.e. for every point on the
may maxbnmn power point line there will be a value of motor speed
and toque +ich is required in order to draw the correct current and voltage fmm
the array.
If the motor is direct-coupled to the pump, then the motor and pump speed and
torque at any given moment must be coincident: where the pump is driven via a
transmission, a fixed ratio wiIl apply together with a small power low due to the
transmission. Pump characteristics are most conveniently represented on a head
versus tlow plane (HQ) as shown inFIgure 30d. Any value of head and flow for the
pomp will require a unique pump speed andtorque, and these can be superiztpused
on the H-Q plane as a set of constant speed and constant torque curves as shown
in the Figure.
The torque and speed values coinciding with the array optimum power line m-m
in Figure 30~ can then be transformed into a coincident line on the pump HQ
plane, as indicated in Figure 30d. In other words there is a unique set of head
and tlow conditions which optimally loads the motor and in turn the array for all
levels of irradiance. These are indicated by the curve m-m in Figure 30d.
The pomp is connected to pipe-work which will have a characteristic in the H-Q
plane of the kind shown io Figure 30e, consisting of the sum of the static head and
pipe energy losses. If the curve m-m from the pump HQ plane is transposed onto
the pipework H-Q plane, (since the head and flow experienced by the pipework
will coincide with those for the pump), then it cau be seen that there is a unique
single IIQ point on the m-m system maximum power or efficiency curve where
maximum efficiency is obtained from the system. This unique point can be
transposed back through the various planes to the array and results in a unique
iradiance level, (and array temperature), where maximum efficiency is obtained
from the system. This shows that for any PV pumping system there is a unique
value of pumping head (total head across the pump) and flow which will optimally
load the array at any irradiance level above the system’s threshold.
It follows from this that PV solar pumping systems need their components to be
carefully matched so that:
0 the motor-pump subsystem loads the array in such a way that as the
irradiance varies, the voltage and current requirements remain at or close
to the maximum power point locus.
0 the system optimum operating point, which will lie on this locus, should
be correct for the head and flow required at the design irradiance level.
Clearly the correct matching of subsystems and arrays is a complex analytical
process which is greatly facilitated through the use of a computer model which
permits an iterative approach to be used.
Figure 3 1 shows the measured characteristics of a typical solar PV pumping system
(PompesG uioard-boreholes ystema t Yangassoin Mali), and it can be seenf rom the
lowest curve in the Figure that this system is optimised to achieve its maximum
efficiency at between 700 and 800W/mz of irradiance. It can also be seen that
the systemr equires about 200W/m* to start and it achievesa maximum system
efficiency of almost 3.5%.

Figure 32 shows the daily output of the same system recorded over a period of
several weeks. There is a lot of scatter because, although two days may have an
equal total cumulative irradiation, the cloud patterns and direct diffuse ratios vary
all the time, which is why the cumulative daily pumped water output and the
overall daily system efficiency are not necessarily the same for a given cumulative
energy input. High daily outputs for a given irradiation level imply more hours of
sunlight at near the optimum irradiance level for the system, and vice-versa.
Figures 33 and 34 show similar curves as for Fieures 3 1 and 32 respectively, but for
the Arco Solar system in the Sudan. This is optimised for a higher lrradiance level
(which is sensible since Sudan will normally have more direct sunshine than Mali)
and this is confmed by the much lower level of scatter in Figure 34, showing that
the solar regime varies much less day by day in the Sudan over the period recorded,
mainly due to the rarity of clouds there at that time of the year (the tests in Mali
were conducted partially during the rainy season).
4.10 Power Conditioners and Maximum Power Point Trackers
It is possible to install an electronic device between the array and the load or subsystem
which will automatically optimise the load on the arrays What this device
does is to effectively alter the load impedance to.match the optimum impedance of
the array. It does this by &awing the voltage current ratio required by the load
through the use of dc-dc voltage transformation; two systems tested (from Solar
Electric International and from SOTEREM) incorporated power conditioners
for this purpose.
The SE1 system uses a maximum power point tracker (MPPT). This monitors the
voltage applied to the load at brief time intervals (and hence the power supplied)
and uses a logic circuit to control a high-efficiency pulse-width modulated down
converter (PWMDC) to match the array operating point to motor demand, (Re
ference 28). The logic uses a ‘hill climbing” technique which causes the system to
hunt for the maximum power of the load condition, and then to hunt by a small
amount (about 1%) either side of the optimum point. If irradiance levels, array
temperatures, the pumping head, or any other conditions change, then the logic
circuit will seek the new maximum power point.
Significant benefits can be gained from a MPPT of this kind, but ironically, the
most benefits would be for a badly designed system with an ill-matched array and
subsystem, or one operating well off its design conditions.
However, the MPPT also consumes a certain amount of power (about 4 to 7%
according to Reference 28), and thereby represents an energy dram which must be
set against the savings it obtains. It also, at present, appears to be an expensive
component, costing as much or more than the electric motor, so in terms of costeffectiveness,
the cost has to be set against energy gamed.
A good system with a well-matched centrifugal pump can be designed so that it
naturally has a close match between the maximum power and efficiency locus of
the array, but systems with piston or other positive displacement pumps do not
match at all naturaIly because a positive displacement pump, at a given head, tends
to draw an almost constant current (it is a constant torque device). Hence, the
voltage needs to be changed to maxlmise the power drawn, which does not happen

naturally with PV arrays under varying irradiance levels. The SOTEREM system
uses a form of MPPT to compensate for this and no doubt MPPTs will have a useful
role in conjunction with positive displacement pumps.
The use of electrical storage batteries, with a charging circuit to switch off the
motor when the battery is discharged and to switch off the array if it is fully
charged, offers another form of power conditioning by permitting the motor/pump
unit to operate under almost constant and optimised I-V conditions. However,
as outlined previously in section 4.6, batteries appear to have so many problems
associated with their use under field conditions which apply to micro-irrigation,
that it remains to be demonstrated whether they would, on balance, be beneficial
in this application.
4.11 The Pmjeet Design Study Mathematierl Model
To investigate the matching of system components as part of the Project design
study described in detail in the accompanying Project Report, the Consultants
developed a computer-based mathematical model of a PV solar pumping system
with which different component performance characteristics could be simulated
and their interactions investigated.
An outline block diagram of the model is given in Figure 35. The model contains
the sets of equations which describe the performance of each component, and
solves them numerically to yield the unique set of H, Q, T, n, I and V values for a
given irradiance level and array temperature.
The motor and pump characteristics used for the model were derived directly from
the data obtained from iaboratory tests of motors and pumps, smoothed by various
normahsation processes to eliminate the scatter that results from practical
experiment. Typical curves from the laboratory testing programme have been used,
e.g. Figure 23 (motor) and Figures 24 to 29 (pumps of various kinds).
The model was validated by making it simulate actual systems tested in the field,
(the subsystems of which were laboratory tested). Figure 36 illustrates a validation
result comparing actual field results with tield simulation results (of the Arco
Solar system tested in the Sudan). A sufficiently satisfactory correlation was
obtained so that the general conclusions drawn from simulated runs of modified or
different systems can be considered as reasonably accurate.
The model has a solar input derived from typical daily recorded irradiance data,
and recalculates H, Q, T, n, I and V for the specified system at predetermined
intervals through the day. It also calculates the pumped output assuming quasisteady
state conditions during the time interval used and adds the output to those
from the previous time intervals to arrive at an integrated value for daily pumped
output, as shown by the Total Volume curve of Figure 36.
To allow a useful comparison between system options, two standard “solar days”
were used as inputs: one was derived from Sudan data for a typical arid region,
with a high proportion of direct radiation and virtually no passing clouds; the
other, derived from Phikppine data had a higher level of diffuse with intermittent
clouds in the afternoon.

FKiURE 36 - VALIDATION OF PHOTOVOLTAK! SYSTEM MODEL (PUMP OUTPUT)
To derive a true cost of unit output of water, it would haveb een necessaryto make
a large number of assumptions not directly related to system concepts, such as the
pattern of use, solar variation through the year, discount rates, economic lifetimes,
etc. To avoid these assumptions a simplification was introduced in which the
capital or fit cost of the system was related to its expected dally output under
the standard solar day in order to express the investment in equipment of a
particular type required to produce a given number of kilo-joules of hydraulic
pumped energy per standard solar day. This gives a relative measure of output costs
from different systems “ail other things not related to the system being equal” i.e.
a measureo f their cost-effectivenessT. he parameteru sed was called “Specific
Capital Cost”* and was computed in units of US$/kJ per day. The Specific Capital
Cost is a reasonablem easureo f system“ goodness” since first cost is in the end the
dominant cost for all solar pumping systems and it can fairly be assumed that
recurrent costs are independent of the concept used.
The cost data used in the model were prepared on the basis of the cost of
components in a typical developing country for large volume orders. Arbitary
factors which enter into the price of particular manufacturers were eliminated by
reference to the power, weight and size of the component concerned.
A programme of model runs was conducted, simulating many of the systems tested
in the tield and then simulating the effects of various modifications on a typical
system. The kinds of modifications investigated were:-

4.12 Resulti obtained from Model Testing
The Project Report (chapter 4.4) discussesth e resultso btained in detail so it is
only intended here to give an outline description of them in so far as they relate to
the general design of solar PV pumping systems.
The Arco Solar system was used extensively as a subject for the model
investigations,b ecauseit is a simple and conventionald esignw hich appearedt o be
reasonablew ell but not perfectly optimised becauseit had a better than average,
but not the best, efficiency; and becauseit seemedt o be potentially one of the
more cost-effectives ystems.A well documenteda nd comprehensived ata basew as
also available largely due to the clear sunny conditions that prevail in the
Khartoum area where the tests took place. Therefore the examples of what might
be possible in the way of improvements use the Arco Solar system as an example,
but could equally apply to virtually all the other systems tested.
Figure 37 shows how the efficiency of the system varies with head; clearly the
system as supplied was effectively optimised for about 7.5m, and performed
reasonably well for heads in the 6 to IOm, range. The array voltage was then
“altered” in the model by increasinga nd decreasingth e cell string length by units
of IO%, keeping the actual number of cells and hence the power rating constant.
To do this in practice would probably need non-standard modules, which would
explain why the systems were often not perfectly optimised. A 13% improvement
in maximum efficiency was obtained with the model of the Arco Solar system by
reducing the array nominal voltage by 20%. A second opthnisation exercise was to
change the array power (number of cells), keeping to the optimum voltage, to
obtain the most cost-effective system; i.e. trading off array cost against output - a
smaller array might mean a reduced output, but the cost might also go down by a
proportionately greater amount. With the present day array cost assumptions built
into the model, the Arco Solar system actually became more cost-effective
according to the model with one less module in the array. Clearly as array costs
change,t he optimum power rating for cost-effectivenesws ill also tend to change.
Figure 38 shows how the cumulative dally output varies with head using the
“Standard hazy day” and the “Standard clear day” solar input. If the system
efficiency remained constant at its maximum level, then a hyperbolically increasing
output curve would be expected as shown by a broken line in the Figure. But due
to declining efficiency at lower heads, the output tends to be almost linearly
related to head; this kind of effect will of course apply to most other systems too.

The use of a MPPT can partially compensateb, ut not to a great extent. This is
becauseth e pump itself variesi n efticiency at different heads,( seef or example
Figure 24), and this affects the system efficiency more profoundly than any
impedance mismatch. The effect of applying a MPPT to the Arco Solar system is
shown in Figure 39. A MPPT with 10% parasitic power drain is ahnost equal to
simple atray voltage and power optimisation (which of course costs much less than
the MPPT) although a hypothetical cost-free MPPT does improve the system
maximum efficiency, but mainly close to the design head.
One of the most cost-effective ways of improving the daily output (and reducing
Specific Capital Cost), was occasionalm anual tracking. This was discussedin detail
earlier in section 2.7.3 under the heading of “system efficiency”.
An initial appraisal was made of the effect of vailation in pipework diameter on
system economics. The result is shown in Figure 40 and confirms the dramatic
importance of not usingp ipes which are too small. Purchasersm ight be tempted
to save a little on the capital cost by accepting small pipes, but this would be
totally vitiated by the cost of the energy consumed in pipe friction. The
SpecfticC apital Cost is sensitiveb ecausep ipe friction is inverselyp roportional to
the fti power of diameter whereas pipe costs are related to the square of
diameter. Footvalves, sharp bends, kinks, valves and unrecovered exit losses all add
to the loss of energy, and attention to detailed design is required if these losses are
to be minim&d.
Table 8 summarisesth e main fmdings in connection with the investigationso f the
modelled Arco Solar system. It can be seen that voltage and power opthnisation
can obtain a 12% reduction in Specific Capital Cost. Manual tracking of the sun
(two adjustments per day) reduces the SCC by 6%. But the combination of the
above two improvements reduces SCC by as much as 32%. The use of a MPPT
with manual tracking (with 10% losses)in creasesth e daily output from 32% to
39% but is lesse ffective in terms of reducingt he SCC,b ecauseo f the quite high
coat of the MPPT.
It must be stressed that these results are indica’ive of the relative merits of
different options as revealed by the model; they apply only under “Standard solar
day” conditions. It remains to be tested under the next Phase of the Project, how
well the improvements predicted by the model can be achieved in practice, by
making the modifications that appear to be beneficial to actual systems and
reteating them.

5. SOLAR PUMPING TECHNOLOGY - THERMAL SYSTEMS
5.1 Isstory
Solar thermal power systems are by no means a new development; a workable solar
steam engine of several horsepower, heated from an axicon focusing collector, was
developed by Mouchot and Pifre in France during the 1870’s. Their engine was
demonstrated driving a small printing press at the Paris Exhibition of 1878.
Willsie and Boyle built a number of solar steam engines with outputs in the 6 to
2Ohp range in the USA between 1902 and 1908, while their contemporary,
Shuman, deveIoped the fmt steam engine to be heated from a flat plate solar
collector, also in the USA. In 1913 Shuman and Boys installed a SOhp solarpowered
irrigation pumping engine near Cairo in Egypt, using linear parabolic
collectors. This pioneering solar irrigation system (and other contemporary systems
in the USA) functioned reasonably effectively until after a few years they were all
supersededb y the introduction of internal combustion enginesd riving pumps
and/or by mains electricity supplies, which at that time were becoming cheaper and
more convenient, (see, for example, Reference 30 for a more detailed historical
account).
The early solar-powered systems mentioned above generally used steam as a working
fluid; therefore concentrating solar collectors with modest concentration
factors were usually usedi n an effort to achievea reasonablec ompromiseb etween
attaining a suffcient steam temperature for adequate engine thermodynamic
effciency yet retaining a low enough concentration factor to mlnimise the
accuracy needed for solar tracking
In contrast, the majority of modem small solar thermal powered systems have used
heavy organic vtpours of the kinds commonly used in refrigeration and air-conditioning
systems as working fluids. These boil at a temperature low enough to
permit the use of non-tracking, flat plate solar collectors at the expense of greater
complexity in the design of the engine expander and rather low thermodynamic
efficiency and consequently a larger collector area requirement to achieve a given
output. There are difficult technical decisions to be made when defining the
design philosophy for solar thermal systems due to the conflicting requirements for
achieving good collector efficiency and good engine efficiency.
Experimental work on solar thermal engines continued in many countries, but it
was not until the 1960’s when it became clear that solar power might have
widespread application in arid, sparsely populated regions, particularly for water
pumping, that serious attempts to develop viable systems were again made, mainly in
France and Israel.
At the present stage of development there has been no clear demonstration that
there is any single optinum approach to solar thermal powered system design. In
any case, factors such as the sire of the system (power output), application and
manufacturing environment, must inevitably introduce important constraints.
Despite the long history of solar thermal powered systems, there are still no
manufacturers producing systems on a commercial basis in the world market. In
the Consultants opinion, none of the systems currently available is as yet sufficiently
developed to be viable in comparison with many other energy conversion

5.2 Existing !bbr TIKNlal Pumping In.9talIations
A number of manufacturers have smallscale solar thermal pumping systems under
development and several have prototype field installations under test. The French
company, Sofretes, is the only manufacturer however with a significant number of
actual field units installed. The units are rated at about 1 kW (mechanical power to
pump) and employ flat plate solar collectors and a reciprocating organic fluid
Rankine cycle engine operating at about 80°C. Overall effciency is about l%,
(solar energyt o shaft power). Theses ystemsa re elaborstea nd well-engineeredb, ut
it is known that for various r:asons many have failed to operate satisfactorily in the
field. The capital cost of these systems also appeared to be too high for economic
operation and it is understood that the majority was fmanced as French overseas
aid. Pumping systems of this size and type are no longer being manufactured by
Sofretes,a st he company hasd ecidedt o concentratei ts solar thermal resourceso n

The theoretical maximum efficiency for conversion of heat energy to mechanical
work was fii defined by Camot as
q,=-h-Tc
Th
where This the absolute temperature of the heat source and Tc is that for the heat
sink. In practice, even with good design, it is not possible to obtain an efficiency
anything like asg ood as the theoretical Camot efficiency nc and in most casesth e
true thermal efficiency for converting heat to work will be in the range 0.3 to 0.6
of uc. Figure 4 1 illustrates this relationship for the temperature range of relevance
for solar thermal systems.
To date there are three main types of thermal systems which have shown potential
for small-scales olar pumping applications.T hesea re:
(a)
0-O
low temperature organic vapour cycle devices (SO0 - 15OOC);
medium temperature water vapour (steam) cycle devices ( 140°C -
3OOoC)a; nd
(@ gas cycle devices (Stirling cycle), using air, hydrogen or helium as working
fluid, requiring input temperatures generally in excess of 3OOOC.
It should be noted that the vapour or Rankme cycle which applies to organic
vapour and steame nginesi s inherently lesse fficient (i.e. a smaller percentageo f
Camot efficiency) than the Stirling gas cycle which the Stirling engine approximately
follows.
114
5.4
In each of these types, the basic principle of establishing a flow of heat and extracting
a proportion of this as work will apply, as illustrated schematically in Figure
42. Normally the heat sink will be the water that is pumped from the ground
(although in some caseait may be the atmosphere)a nd the sink temperaturei s
unlikely to be lesst han about 2SoC in the countries of main relevanceto solar
pumping. The greater the temperature difference between the heat source and the
heat sink, the greater will be the thermal efficiency of the heat engine with less
solar energy required for a given work output. It would thus appear that a solar
thermal system should have as high an input temperature to the expander as
possible in order to maxhnise the temperature difference between source and sink.
Unfortunately, the efficiency of solar collectors decreasesa s the temperature
betweent heir output and ambient increasesb, ecausec ollector heat lossesin crease
in proportion to this temperature difference. Therefore the optimum requirements
for heat engine efficiency are opposite to those for solar collector efficiency.
As a result of the conflicting requirements of heat engines and solar collectors,
various technical trade-offs are required which result in a number of combinations
of different types of solar collectors and engines. There is no obvious, clear cut
winning approach and this is the main reason why there is such a variety of
different solar thermal systems under development.
so&r TheNlal couectors
Typical curves showing the variation of collector efficiency with temperature
difference for various types of solar thermal collector are given in Figure 43. From
thesec urves,i t can be seent hat simple single-glazedfl at plate collectorsb ecome
particularly inefficient if expected to produce heat at temperature differences
greater than about 750C. By adding sophistication to a flat plate collector in the
form of double glazing and special selective surface finishes that reduce the
emission of heat from the absorber surface, acceptable efficiency with temperature
differences in the range 80 to IOOOC becomes possible. However, to obtain
temperatured ifferencesi n excesso f 1OOoCw hile retaining acceptablee fficiency
demands the use of a concentrating solar collector.
A concentrating solar collector must be aligned with sufficient accuracy to ensure
that the focus coincides with the heat absorber. The greater the degree of
concentration, the more accurately must the concentrator be aligned and of course
any such device has to follow the sun during the course of the day to keep the
focus coincident with the absorber. This introduces the complication of mounting
the concentrating collector in such a way that it may be tracked and an accurate
tracking mechanism is also needed. Several methods have been demonstrated for
tracking, including electronically controlled electric servo drives (where photo-cells
are used to sense the alignment with the sun); clockwork drives timed to follow the
sun correctly; and a number of promising devices in which misalignment is
detected by a sensor cylinder containing a liquid/vapour combination which is
normally just shaded by the concentrator mirror. If the sun illuminates the sensor
cylinder, the heat boils the Uquid and pressurisetsh e vapour which drivesa servo
mechanism to move the mirror sufficiently to bring the sensing cylinder back into a
shaded position. Some of these tracking methods may also he applied to
concentratinga nd event o flat plate photovoltaic arrays,a s discussedin Chapter 4.

Figure 43 shows a comparison of measured performance results from Reference 3 1,
and illustrates that vari& line focus collectors can achieve efficiencies cf around
70% at temperatures of up to 3000C. By comparison, a double glazed selective
surface flat plate collector is rather inefficient.
Major technical problems with tracking concentrators lie in obtaining a sufficiently
&able tracking mechanism, in mounting the reflector array in such a way that it
tracks easily but is not influenced by strong winds, and in providing a mirror
surface which will withstand such effects as ram, dust, bird excrement, ultra-violet
radiation, thermal shock and rough handling. It is however important to note that
tracking concentratorsd o haveo ne major advantageo ver fixed flat plate units In
addition to obtaining a higher temperature In that they can receive considerably
more solar energy during the course of the day, particularly in early morning and in
the evening, as they turn to face the sun (as explained in section 2.7, see Figures
4A and B, SA and B). The fvted flat plate collector surface will receive attenuated
solar energy early and late in the day due to the acute angle of the sun’s rays.
Theoretically, a tracking collector will receive “/2 times the solar radiation per unit
area per day than a fixed one. In practice, an even greater gain in output, sometimes
exceedinga factor of two, hasb een observedT. his may be accountedf or by
considering that, in addition to the geometric effects, fixed flat plate collectors
have greater reflection losses when receiving solar radiation at an acute angle.
A tracking collector may thus be expected to receive significantly more energy per
day per unit area of collector and be able to start up much earlier and keep going
much toter in the day. If the difficulties of constructing a reliable and robust
tracking concentrator can be overcome, there are substantial technical and
economic benefits to be gained. Consideration may also be given to mounting flat
plate non-concentrating collectors on gymbals to permit approximate manual
tracking; by turning the collector eastwardsin the morning and westwardsi n the
afternoon significant gains may be expected, (See Figures 5A and B).
Most concentrating solar thermal collectors available today are of the parabolic
trough type, achieving temperatures of between 100 and 3000C. Higher
temperatures are possible by either using parabolic dish mirror collectors, which
have a point focus rather than the line focus of the trough, or by using a field of
tracking mirrors individually aimed at a central “power tower” target. Although
quite high engine efficiencies could be achieved from systems of this kind, the
tracking requirements are more precise which makes these approaches appear
difficult for small thermal systems required for this Project.
However one potentially useful application of concentrating collectors is the use
of a parabolic dish collector with a Stirling engine system. At least one
manufacturer (Sunpower Inc., USA) is developing a system of this kind and it is
possible that the gains offered by the use of a Stirling cycle heat engine wili
compensatefo r the more rigorous tracking requirements.
For many applications, such as industrial process heat and power generation, concentrating
collectors have been shown to be more cost-effective than flat plate
collectors. Parabolic trough collectors have been used for relatively large scale
water pumping systems in the USA although only one system at Coolidge, Arizona,
has performed satisfactorily and is still in operation.

Some manufacturers and systems analysts consider that the use of evacuated
collectors may prove to be the most cost-effective solution for systems requiring
moderately high temperature. They have been shown to have good collection
efftciea*:y,d erived from their low heat lossesa, nd severalm anufacturersi n various
parts of the world have started limited production. No estimates are as yet availabh
of their probable manufacturing costs for large-scalep roduction and for the present
they must be regarded as promising but unproven.
In contrast, solar ponds have been proposed as a simple, cheap method of collecting
and storing solar energy, potentially on a large scale. Such a pond is a shallow
body of water, typically 1 to 2m deep, with a black bottom. When incident solar
radiation penetrates the pond, some is absorbed by the liquid and a large
pioportion reaches the bottom and is absorbed by the black surface which is consequently
heated. Thus water at the bottom of the pond reaches a higher temperature
than that nearer the surface. Convection currents which would normally
developa nd equahset his temperatured ifference are preventedb y the presenceo f
a strong density gradient from bottom to top through the use of dissolved salts (or
by plastic membranes). Many natural salt water ponds are known which exhibit
thesep roperties,a nd scientific researchin to their useb egani n the 1950’si n Israel.
The principal aim of reaseachin to solar ponds hasb een concernedw ith methods of
extracting energy from the pond. Success has been achieved by recycling the hot
layers through a heat exchanger and temperatures of 9OoC have been achieved.
Currently a power generation system using an Ormat turbine is operating in Israel.
In India solar ponds have been used for the production of salt and for biogas
digester heating.
The’solar pond could be a useful collector for solar pumping systems but must be
designed for a specific location and is as yet inadequately developed. Work is
currently in progress in the USA, funded by the Department of Energy (DOE)
to establish the feasibility of shallow solar pond-driven irrigation pumping systems
(Reference 32). Present indications are that for a large (12OkW) system, the
shallow solar pond option is less expensive than other DOE funded installations
which use concentrating collectors.
5.5 Rankine Cycle Engines
Nearly all solar thermal engines available or under development today are based
on the Rankine or similar cycle, in which the working fluid undergoes a phase
change from iiquid to vapour hi a boiler, followed by expansion of the vapour
through an expander mechanism to extract work, after which the vapour is
condensed back to liquid and transferred by a feed pump back to the boiler to be
reheated for another cycle.
A typical Rankhte cycle system in its simplest form is shown diagramma’ically in
Figure 44. The working fluid is directly evaporatedin the solar collector before
passing to the expander which drives the working fluid feed pump as well as the
main water pump. The water is used to cool the condenser. The systems being
developed for example, by Dormer (West Germany) and Solar Pump Corporation
(USA) utihse this cycle, with Freon as the working fluid.

The system shown in Figure 45 is sintilar except that water is used in the solar
collectors, with an intermediate heat exchanger transferring heat to the working
fluid. This arrangement has been adopted, for example, for the systems developed
by Sofretes (France) and Ormat (Israel).
Systems operating at temperatures below about 15OoC generally use an organic
working fluid, as the use of water presents technical problems. Fluoro-carbons of
the Freon type, as commonly used in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment,
havet he advantageo f lower boiling points at useful pressuresa nd higher vappur
densities than steam, thereby permitting more compact systems with higher
efficiency.
A few systems have been developed or proposed which use organic hydrosarbon
vapours as a working fluid (butane being a commonly applied one). The main
objection to the use of this kind of working fluid arises from their high
flammability which could prove a serious hazard in the event of a leak developing.
Even more hazardous than butane are working fluids such as n-pentane (proposed
for one system), which has both a very low flash point and high volatility. The
Freons (and other fluoro-carbons) on the other hand are non-flammable and
reasonably safe with regard to toxicity.
When any organic working fluid is used, it becomes esaential to contain the fluid
in the system with 100% reliability since even the smallest of leaks will eventually
cause the vapour cycle to cease functioning. Also, these fluids are relatively
expensive, so it is worth minimising the quantity required to fill the system.
Some systems have been proposed which incorporate a heat store in the solar
collector circuit, introduced between the solar collector and the intermediate heat
exchanger.T he simplest form of heat store consistso f a large water or brine vessel,
but some systems involve the transfer of latent rather than sensible heat through
the melting and solidifying of waxes or salt mixtures or the evaporation and condensation
of a separate vapour. In this way a large quantity of heat can be stored
and cycled through quite a small temperature range. It seems that this technology
may in some cases be an important adjunct to the use of small solar thermal
systems to provide a thermal buffer between the rather variable temperature of the
output from the solar collectors and the fixed temperature conditions which are
desirable for rurmlng a vapour expander. Naturally a heat store involves further
complication and expense, and therefore requires thorough evaluation before
being incorporated into a small-scalep umping systemi ntended to meet the special
requirements of this Project.
An interesting variation of the Rankine cycle system is under development in India
by Hindustan Brown Boveri in association with the Indian Institute of Technology,
Kanpur, who claim that becauseo f its mechanicals implicity, it is likely to be much
leas expensive than conventional solar thermal systems. The most basic
arrangement they propose is illustrated in Figure 46. A volatile organic fluid is used
which is immiscible with water. The fluid is heated to a temperature in the flat
plate collectors 1 such that it will flash into vapour in the flash tank 2. When
sufticient pressure has developed in the primary system, valve 3 opens and the
vapour expands into chamber 4 and displaces water from the chamber via a nonreturn
valve and rising main 5 to tank 6. Some of the water from tank 6 is
circulated through heat exchange pipes in expansion chamber 4 and causes the

~, prototype includu a .number of further tanks and connections. Although the
plumbing appears quite complex, this device is attractive in that it has no
mechanical expander and pump, the vapour interacting directly with the water to
be pumped, so it should be potentially reliable and long lasting providing the
organic working fluid can be adequately contained. This is important since the
prototype appears to use n-pentane as a working fluid and this is a dangerously
llammable vapour.
The Hindustan Brown Boveri system is still at the prototype skate, but was said to
be close to being marketed by the manufacturer in 19?9. It is not be!ieved to have
been launched as a commercially available product at the time of writing.
Another type of low temperature simple device involves the evaporation or boiling
of an organic low boiling point fluid, which displacesm ore liquid fluid to a higher
level. The weight of the collected fluid is then used to do work while it is returned
to a lower level. Systems of this kind are inherently large in relation to their power
rating, but could ln theory be reasonably efficient. Two manufacturers are
understood to be developing devices of this kind, Sunpower Systems (USA), who
offer the “Minto Wheel” and Grinakers( Pty) Ltd., (Johannesburg)w, ho havea
rocking device called the “Camel”. The latter device appears promising on the basis
of the cost and performance figures quoted by the original inventor but
unfortunately little or no information has been releasedb y the licensees.
The principle of the so-called “Camel” is believed to be as illustrated in Figure 47.
The working fluid, Freon, is evaporated in the flat plate collector (1). The vapour
displacesli quid Freon from a reservoir( Z), which in turn travelsu p a flexible pipe
to the reservoirt 3), where it condensesW. hens ufficient condensateh as collected it
overbalances the arm (4), thereby delivering some water as the arm is connected to
a piston pump. A valve, (S), then opens automatically and returns the condensate
by gravity to a lower reservoir (6), and thence back to the solar collector (1). The
consultantsh ave certain reservationsa bout the inventor’s original performance
claims for this device,b ut its simplicity, apparentr obustnessa nd low cost make it
appear potmtially attractive for use by farmers in developing countries. The
licensee was unable or unprepared to supply us with a system to test to verify the
performance that had been claimed.
Unlike photovoltaic systems, where there are not many options for using an
electrical output to pump water, there are a great variety of options for using hot
vapour or hot gas to drive an engine and pump. In fact many photovoltaic system
designers use “off-the-shelf’ commercially available motors and pumps, but a
thermal system designer generally has to design and develop at least the engine
and often the pump and transmission too, which probably accounts for the less
advanced level of development of smali-scale solar thermal pumping systems,
compared with solar PV systems.

AU Rankine or vapour cycle systems require an expander and there are in effect
three broad categories of device which can be used; small turbines, rotary positive
displacement expanders and reciprocating positive displacement expanders. In
addition to such desirable characteristics as long life and high reliability with
minimal maintenance needs, an important expander characteristic is its expansion
efftciency fisentmpic efficiency) which provides a measure of its effectiveness at
converting heat into work. Unfortunately smail turbines tend to be inherently inefBcient
as extremely high standards of surface fmish, coupled with very small
clearances and high rotational speeds, are necessary if a good isentropic efficienc~~
is to be achieved. Therefore, positive displacement expanders are more common
the sixe range of interest for this Project.
Rotary positive displacement expanders include vane machines, screw expanders
and analogous arrangements to most common types of compressor or blower (e.g.
Roots, Centric, Swashplate-axial-piston). Reciprocating devices appear at present
to ‘be the cheapest and most reliable option at this scale. They can take the form of
the traditional steam engine with a piston in a cylinder, such as the steam system
bebsg developed by Jyoti Limited fbtdia), or they can incorporate diaphragms OT
m&sock seals (generally preferred for organic vapottr working fluids where 100’;’
vapour retention is vital), or they can be liquid displacement devices such as the
shown In Fiires 46 and 47.
5.6 StirBn~ cyck Eninal
Stirling (or Eriksson) cycle en&es use a gas such as air, hydrogen or helium as a
working fluid and are generally capable of higher thermodynamic efficiencies than
Rankine cycle engines at a given upper operating temperature. Their heat exchange
interfaces also can be smaller and therefore cheaper, but in practice Stirling engines
require heat inputs at temperatures in excess of about 3OOoC, so that a solar
powered Stirling engine would almost certainly require a high concentration factor
point focussing solar collector or power tower which in turn needs accurate solar
tracking.
The Stirling engine was patented in 1816 by the Rev. Robert Stirring. John
E&son patented an open cycle variant during the 1850’s. The Eriksson engine
became very widely used for fractional horsepower applications (in preference to
small steam engines) during the latter part of the nineteenth century, particularly
in the USA, and was usually fuelled with wood or coal. An example using a
parabolic mirror to focus the sun’s rays through a window in its absorber was
reportedly demonstrated in 1872 and may have been the first solar powered engine
ever. Widespread electrification rendered the small Eriksson engines obsolete during
the early decades of this century, when fractional horsepower electric motors took
over.
In recent years considerable effort has been made to develop high technology
Stirling engines capable of competing with diesel engines for automotive
applications (advantages of better efficiency coupled with less noise and less
exhaust pollution have been claimed). Another development has been the evolution
of the free-piston Stirling engine by Beaie and others. (References 33 and 34).
At least two manufacturers are developing devices based on the Stirling cycle which
offer promise for small-scale solar pumping applications. Sunpower Inc. (USA) are
developing the “Beale enghte” and Metal Box (India) Limited in Calcutta are
developing the “Fluidyne” pump originally invented by the UK Atomic Energy
- -
125
Authority at Harwell. Both devices are said by their developers to be close to
commercial production; the Beale engine was in fact laboratory tested under this
project as explained below but the respectived evelopments cheduleso f Metal Box
(India) and the laboratory programme of this Project made it impossible for us to
test a “Fluidyne” pump, although a reproduction basin was seen working at the
manufacturer*sp remisesi n Calcutta, India.
The “Fluidyne” pump in particular is worth describing in more detail. As
illustrated schematically in Figure 48, water is caused to oscillate in a U-shaped displacer
tube, one end of which is heated and the other cooled. The movement of the
water causes air trapped above the U-tube to be displaced through a closed air
pipe joining the two sides; the air pipe acts as a regenerator and stores heat from air
as it is pushed from the hot side to the cooled side and gives up its heat to the cool
returning air. The alternate heating and cooling of a fixed mass of air causes
pressurea nd volume variations which not only excite the displacerw ater motion
in the correct phasing.b ut are also used to pump water as the pressurea lternatively
draws water from the inlet valve and expels water through the delivery valve. The
original “Fluidyne” pump as reported by Hanvell was very inefficient, but we are
informed by the Metal Box Company that they have made a significant
breakthrough and that an overall efficiency of around 3% has been obtained (with
electrical heat input under test conditions the overall efficiency was absar 7%).
The present pump is designed to be heated by coal wood orges; clearly if reasonable
efficiency can be obtained with a direct solar input, the extreme simplicity
and lack of moving mechanical components would make this device very attractive
for use under agricultural field conditions.
Experimental work involving the use of the traditional mechanically-coupled.
Stirling engine has been reported by Puri (Reference 35). Also, it is understood
that Philips NV, in the Netherlands, have been involved in the development of a
small Stirling engine to power an electrical generator for running an irrigation
pump, (References9 and 20), although it is believedt his programmei s no longer
active.
Another interesting type of Stirling cycle devicef or small-scales olar pumping is the
free-piston Stirling engine, or Beale engine, under development by Sunpower Inc.
(USA). This device was tested under the Project, and is illustrated in Figure 49. The
thermodynamic working fluid is helium gasp ressurisedto about S bar; low atomic
weight gasesli ke helium have particularly good thermal conductivity, especially
when pressurisedT. he Figure illustrates the version tested which had an electrical
heater: when solar-powered, the hot end of the engine would be mounted at the
focus of a point focusing parabolic collecior, (or it could be installed in a power
tower).
The principle of the free-piston Stirling engine is complex and depends on interactions
betweenv ibrating componentsc onstrainedb y springs.T he stainlesss teel
displacement piston and the brass working piston are interconnected by springs and
by the viscosity of the working fluid in such a way that they vibrate (with critical
damping) 900 out of phase with each other. This shifts the working fluid (helium
gas) from the hot space above the displacement piston, through the annular wire
matrix regenerator, (which takes heat out of the gas), io the cool space between
the displacementa nd working pistons. The gasc ools and reducesi n pressurea s a
result, which draws up the working piston and the connected pump diaphragm.

The displacer then moves back downwards through its natural vibrations and the
working piston moves up and the working fluid is displaced back through the
regenerator, where it picks up stored heat, to the hot space. The working fluid
then reachesth e peak pressureo f the cycle and drivest he working piston and the
pump diaphragm downwards and the cycle repeats itself.
5.7 Tmmmkmions and Pumps
AR mechanical expanders (engines) will provide either a rotating shaft output or a
reciprocating shaft output. The former can be coupled to a rotary pump in much
the same way as described for photovoltaic pumping systems using a mechanical
tmmmimion; hydraulic drive or direct drive being used where a suitable rotary
pump to match the output speed is available. It is also possible to drive an electrical
generator and transmit the output electrically to a suitable electric pump unit, in
which case the comments on the relative efficiency of different electrical machines
as given in section 4.5. will also apply. Most of the comments in section 4.7 on
pumps also apply with equal validity here too. Reciprocating output expanders
offer a convenient possibility of coupling directly to the pump, provided the
frequency matches that required for efficient pump operation, but for the reasons
given in section 4.7 such systems are more likely to be appropriate for medium or
high rather than low lift pumping.
5.8 Testing of Themtaf Systems

(compared with 10 different PV Systems).
This sole thermal system, by Solar Pump Corporation of Las -legas, Nevada, USA,
is illustrated schematically in Figure SO.
It consistso f a simple, single-glazedfl at-plate collector, (2), fixed to a support
frame (I). The design working fluid is Rl I (Freon I I) which is boiled in the
collector absorber (3), the hot liquid Freon flashes into vapour through a control
valve (6) to the expander (7). The expander is located in the centre of the
collector, which is a good design feature to keep it warm; it consists of a
reciprocating diaphragm with linked valves and looks rather akin to the vacuum
servo units used to boost automobile or truck brakes. The expander directly works
a lever arm (8), which carries the pump rod connected to the well pump cylinder
assembly (12). The same lever arm (8) works a small feed pump which returns
condensed Freon from the condenser (9) built into the support frame, to the solar
collector. The condenser is cooled by water lifted from the well, which is delivered
directly from the condenser water outlet, (I 3). The whole unit is compact and well
integrated, being 2.7m wide by 2.0m from front to back and 1.8m high.
The Solar Pump Corporation system was installed near Khartoum in the Sudan for
testing, but due to delays and problems in commissioning this system, (as more
fully explained in the Project Report), it was not possible to conduct more than
superficial testing during the fit Phasel However, it demonstrated a

hydraulic pumped power output of 45W and an overall system efficiency of 0.9%.
The price of the unit was competitive with many of the PV systems tested and the
Cons&ants believe that the output and efficiency quoted above are not necessarily
optimum and that there is some scope for design improvement. The system was
also given brief tests at the manufacturer’s works.
The Pmject also gamed fmt-hand experience with solar thermal systems by
armnging for tests to be carried out on prototype systems at their manufacturers’
works at Ormat Turbines Ltd. (Israel) and Domier System GmbH (W Germany). In
addition, a small Stirling engine pumping system by Sunpower Inc., (USA) was
tested for the Project at the University of Reading in the UK This work is
described in detail in the Project Report.
The Ormat system was just outside the scope of this Project, having a turbine using
Freon as a working tluid, driving an eiectrical generator with a maximum rating of
4.7 kW. The engine and generator efticiency was 6%, implying a system efficiency
of about 2.2% if a collector efficiency of 60% is assumed with a similar pump
efficiency.
The Domier system had a maximum hydraulic (pumped) power output of about
230W. The engine/pump efficiency was measured at 3.5%, implying a likely system
efftciency of about 2.0%.
The Sungower Stirling engine pump unit (See Figure 49) failed to perform to its
manufacturer’s specification and then suffered a component failure which damaged
it and cut short its test pmgramme. It is believed that it may have been damaged in
ttansit, which would account for its worse than expectedp erformance,evenb efore
the component failure. Under test at Reading University it only developed a
hydraulic pumped output of 23SW with an engine/pump efficiency of 1.8%
(implying an overall system efficiency with a point-focusing concentrator of about
1.2%). The manufacturers claimed a hydraulic output of about 8OW, which implies
an engine/pump efficiency of about 8% or an overall efficiency of about 5% with a
point focusing solar concentrator; this claim appears plausible for a device of this
kind operating at temperatures of between 500 and 6OOOC.
However, this free-piston Stirling engine prototype is a piece of precision engineer
ing which is vulnerable to damage due to the close fits and quite thin-walled
componentsc ontained in it. Neverthelesso, nce fully developed,i t may well be a
compacta nd efficient small-scales olar thermal pumping system.
5.9 Thenml System De&r Studies
5.9.1 Introduction and Scope
The Project thermal design studies inevitably were much more tentative in
their approach and conclusions than were those for photovoltaic systems,
because there has been very little experience with workable small-scale
solar thermal systems, despite their long history. However, some
interesting and perhaps significant conclusions have come out of the study
which is described in the comparison Project Report, and these are
outlined below.
131
5.9.2
Most of the earliest work on solar pumping was concerned with the use of
heat engines;i ndeed someo f the fit achievementsin the useo f solar
energy in the early part of this century were with thermodynamic pumps.
In spite of this previous experience it became clear dining the early part of
this Project that small solar thermodynamic water pumps have not been
developed to the stage where reliable systems can be obtained
commercdy.
It was not possible therefore to obtain much fit hand experience with,
or data from, working solar thermodynamic pumping systems. Data were
obtained from only one complete system operatmg from solar
power, that of the Solar Pump Corporation system, when tests were
performed on the system at the manufacturer’s premises. Accordingly it
was agreedt hat the Consultants would undertake the necessaryd esign
studies in order to:
0) determine whether it is feasible that solar thermodynamic pumps
could compete with photovoltaic systems
(ii) identify directions in which technical developments can be made
taking particular account of what could be manufactured within develop
ing countries rather than what could be achieved with advanced
technologies. It was further agreed that a mathematical model should be
constructed and used to achieve these objectives.
The Model
(0 Approach
The operating characteristics of solar collectors and heat
rejection systems are very sensitive to temperature, and will vary
depending on the way the components interact. This means that
successfuol peration of a solar thermodynamic pump is critically
dependent on close matching of the components.
Comprehensivem athematical modelling of the performanceo f a
solar thermodynamic pumping system was beyond the scope of
this study. Indeed this could not be possibleb ecausein sufficient
data are available to validate such a model.
It was thought, however, that it would be feasible to use a simple
model to compare the likely performance and costs which might
be achieved from different combinations of solar collectors and
engines.
The limited validity of this approach is clearly recognised; in
particular the dynamic behaviour of thermal systems is of great
importance but resources were not available to study this.

5.9.3 Function of the Thermal Systems Model
The model takes the performancec haracteristicso f known solar collectors
and thermal engine types and combines them. Figure 41 shows how the
ericciencyo f enginesim provesw ith increasingt emperature,w hile Figure
43 indicates how thermal collector efftciencies decline with temperature.
When collectors are combined with engines, an optimum operating
temperature exists, where maximum system efficiency is obtained, which
representsth e best trade-off between the contIicting requirements.F igure
51 indicates the effects on the efficiency of Rl 1 (Freon 11) Rankine
cyde systemsu sing a) a single-glazeds imple flatplate solar collector and b)
using a line-focusing moderate concentration factor collector This latter
example is about the upper temperature limit at which R 11 can be used.
Reference to Figure 6 in section 2.7 gives a useful indication of where
the principal lc,aseos ccur on a complete small-scales olar thermal pumping
system. It must be remembered that the overall efficiency figures of
Fii 5 I refer only to the collector and Raukins eugine prbr? mere:; a
water pump plus the transmissiona nd pipework associatedw ith it will,
as shown in Figure 7, introduce further losses so that the “overall
efficiency” of Figure S 1 needs to be reduced by from 40 to 80% for a
complete smaU-scalpeu mping system.
For comparison, Rankine water-based (steam) systems using the same
kind of Line-focusc ollector are also indicated. In one caset he steami s
condensed at atmospheric pressure, (i.e. 100% as in an open cycle
system exhausting to atmosphere) and in. the other case, sub-atmospheric
pressurec ondensingi s assumeda, t 55oC.
Lower temperature condensing has the same effect as higher temperature
boiling in widening the temperature difference between the heat source
and sink and thereby improves the thermal efficiency. Both water based
options would have an optimum operating temperature above 200°C, but
for the purposes of the modelling exercise it was assumed that this is the
upper temperature limit for reasonably simple line-focus collectors and
tracking systemsa s weU as in relation to the pressuresa nd conditions
that would apply in the engine. This is bearing in mind that very small
systems for use by farmers in developing countries are being considered.
The comparatively flat curves for concentrating linear focus collectors in
Figure 43 might appear to suggesthey are radically superior to flat plate
coUectors,b ut it must be rememberedt hat the main casef or the useo f
tIat plate collectors is on account of their relative simplicity and therefore
aUegedlo w costsc omparedw ith tracking systems.
136
It is also worth noting that so far as concentrating, tracking systems are
concerned,t heir cost and complexity increasec onsiderablya s a function
of the concentration factor (i.e. operating temperature) due to the need
for more precise focusing and tracking and to greater difficulties inherent
in avoiding excessiveh eat lossesw hen transmitting the working fluid from
the absorber tube(s) to the engine.
Therefore the relatively high efficiencies obtainable from certain linear
focus tracking systems at temperatures as high as 250 to 300°C may only
be bought at a considerable cost both in terms of complexity and actual
collector cost; however, with clever design it may also be possible to
achieve such temperatures efficiently, reliably and at competitive costs.
The modelling exercise attempted to introduce various cost assumptions
in assessintgh e relative merits of different systems.T his is vital, since a
purely technical assessmenwt ill inevitably simply prove that higher
temperature systems are both more efficient and (consequently) much
smaller; it would not say whether the greater efficiency and reduced size
results in greater or lesserc ost-effectivenesso r how the apparent costeffectiveness
appears to compare with small-scale solar photovoltaic
pumping systems.
The results of the modelling exercise were presented in terms of Specific
Capital Cost, in exactly the same way as for the PV system cost analysis; a
value of this is to allow direct comparison with solar PV pumping system
LUJW ds uncusseu III the pteceeding cnapter. S?ecitic Capital Cost is a
measure of the investment required to install a system capable of
producing a given hydraulic pumped energy output under a standard daily
irradiation regime.
The input/output requirement used as a basis for comparing a variety of
collector and engine combinations was:
0 solar input 6kWh/m’ per day (same pattern as for the PV model
analysis described earlier).
0 engine output, with the above input required to be 2kWh of shaft
energy per day (which would represent 600Wh of pumped
output per day if a 30% efficient pump were used. This is typical
of the low head efficiency that would have to be expected using
a positive displacement pump best suited for use with a Rankine
engine; at higher heads the pump efticiency might reach 60% or
more, giving 1200Wh/day of output from the same size system).
Since t’lermal systems are more likely to improve in efficiency if their size
is increased, an analysis was also initiated into the likely costs of a system
designed to deliver IOkWh/day of shaft power under similar input
conditions.
There were many assumptionst hat necessarilyh ad to be made as to the
effects of economies of scale on the system components, many relating to
the pump, rather than the engine itself. The result is the product of multiplying
these assumptionsto gether and in many ways Indicated little more

than a larger system would be somewhat more costeffective. How much
more cost-effective cauld only reliably be determined through
considerable further data collection and analysis. Since it is felt that the
main value of this analysis is to show the relative merits of different
system concepts in very broad and basic terms, and consideration of a
larger system did not alter the apparent relative merits of the different
concepts ove: the scale range chosen, it was decided not to proceed with
work on the lOkWh/day system analysis.
For each system concept considered, the model calculates:
0 the optimum operating temperature,
0 the area of collector and size of engine and condenser necessary
to achieve the required output with the input energy level
specified,
0 and, hence the Specific Capital Cost to be expected for each
system concept, (derived from cost data used in the manner
shown in Table 13).
5.9.4 Results of Thermal Systems Analysis
The results are presented in Table 12 and Figures 52 and 53. Figure 52
givesa n indication of the relative cost-effectivenesosf the different system
concepts analysed, so it involves both technical and cost assumptions.
Figure 53, on the other hand, simply shows the relative collector areas
required for each concept and is therefore purely based on technical considerations;
collector costs are dominant in general and therefore the area
of collector needed is of interest.
The greatest uncertainty when going from the assumptions of Figure 53
to those of Figure 52 is the price differential between sophisticated point
focus collectors and power towers and the less sophisticated line focus
collectors (and their tracking mechanisms)a nd flat plate collectors.T here
is uncertainty on how mass-production might reduce the relative unit
costs of the more sophisticated collectors compared with flat plate
collectors; the analysis is based on present day costs and projections and
compares technologies at different stages of maturity and scale of
production.
On the cost ‘wsumptions used, which it is believed are reasonably close to
present day reality, it seems that the improved efficiency resulting from a
greater temperature difference (either through a hotter collector or a
cooler condenser) is cost-effective. In other words, the higher temperature
and more efficient systems invariably show significant reductions in
Specific Capital Costs compared with conventional simple low
temperature flat-plate collector systems.
it should be noted that if the collector termiology used in Table 12 is
unfamiliar, the types of collector refered to are specified in more detail
in Table 10.

futed.tIat-plate collectors driving Rl 1 engines appear to be about
. the least cost-effective option. This conclusion is at variance with
the trends of recent years as aspiring manufacturers have used
precisely this apparently wrong approach.
tracking introduces significant economies even with flat plate
collectors, for the kind of reasons detailed in section 2.7 and
illustrated in Figures 4A and B,,5A and B. Compare examples 2,4
and 8 in Figure 52 with their tracking equivalents 1,3 and 9.
systems using RI 1 as a working fluid appear cheaper than similar
systems (using the same type of collector) with steam as a
working fluid, even when operating at a lower temperature. This
is mainly because Rl 1 has better thermodynamic characteristics

mucn smaller system, as is also clearly evident from comparing
areas of collectors of similar concepts in Figure 53. However, the
steam engine might be able to overcome its size disadvantage
through simpler and lower cost construction.
Piston Stirling engines operating at high temperatures appear very
attractive, but they are still far from practical use and many
“ifs” are built into the cost assumptionsT. he main reasonf or
their apparent low costs is the small size that results from their
high efficiency. They are almost certainly the most efficient
method of converting solar energy into shaft power currently
available, and could become cheap through mass production if a
successful and reliable design is perfected, since the material
requirements for them are much smaller than for other types of
system. Against these virtues must be balanced the cost and complexity
of both the high temperature engine and of the high
concentration factor collector with a very precise tracking
mechanism (two axis).
the Fluidyne liquid piston engine/pump which operates on the
Stirling cycle in the form produced by Metal Box Ltd., has
made rapid progress towards commercialisation.
central receiver systems (power towers) are usually associated
with large-scale solar thermal systems and have received
surprisingly little attention for small-scalea pplications. They
appear attractive for this kind of application, but are not in
production for such small-scaleu sage.
the fixed E-W trough collector, (with occasional seasonal
reorientation in the vertical plane), appears unattractive, being
little better than a futed flat plate collector.
143
h) a simple parabolic trough (or linear Fresnel lens) concentrator
appears attractive for use in the medium to short term as it offers
appreciablea dvantageso ver flat plate collectors and yet is quite
a well developed concept with numerous examples on the commercial
market, (intended mainly for heating commercial buildings
or for process heat).
0 the analysis of the same concepts used to deliver lOkWh/day
produced the same general cost patterns, but the differences
appeared to be more marked.
j) the use of evacuated tube collectors results in a marked reduction
of sixe compared with conventional fiat plate collectors; with a
ZkWh/day non-tracking system the reduction was from 36 down
to 13 m* . Many uncertainties surround projections of the future
coat of mass produced evacuated tube collector and how
competitive they would be for this application in cost terms.
Also, the durability of evacuated tubes under field conditions
remains to be demonstrated.
k) quantity production of systems having a RI 1 (Freon) engine and
linafocus parabolic trough collector could result in a system
having a Specific Capital Cost of S 1 .S/kJ per day (and an actual
capital cost for a 2kWh shaft power per day output of around
$3300,.
It should be noted that the tracking/concentrating thermal systems that
appearf rom the analysist o be so advantageoucso mparedw ith flat-plate
systems, can only utillae the direct beam component of solar energy
received while the latter can use diffuse radiation too. This was allowed
for in the analysis, although solar data from an arid region (Sudan) were
used.
In areas with a high proportion of diffuse solar irradiation, the difference
between flat plate and concentrating systems would be narrower, but this
would not be through the flat-plate systems becoming more cost-e.ffective,
rather than the concentrating systems would be less.
5.9.5 Comparison between thermal and PV small scale pumping systems
Table 8 indicates that given certain improvements, plus manufacture in
reasonableq uantity, it should be possiblea t presentd ay pricest o obtain a
Specific Capital Cost of around $2.3/kJ per day from PV systems. This
compares with the XC of around 8 S/kJ per day for imperfectly
optimised presentday PV systems manufactured in very small quantities.
However, it is highly likely that by the time PV systems are manufactured
in some quantity (i.e. throusands of units) the price of photocells will
have fallen by 50% to around SS/W pk and, as previously explained, it is
probable that within a few years the price of PV cells will fall to nearer
Sl orS2/Wpk.
144
A price of 65/W pk (50% reduction in PV cell costs) reduces the XC of a
well optimised PV system from 2.3 to about S 1.6 kJ per day. If the
price of PV cells falls to S2/W pk. then the PV system SCC would correspondingly
fall to about S l.Z/kJ per day. Further reductions in PV cell
costs do not have a very significant effect on PV Specific Capital Cost
since the balance of system costs dominate. Probably a XC at present
dollar values of around S I/ kl per day is the absolute lower limit that
could be achieved for small, low-head, PV systems.
Therefore it does seem pmbable that well-optimised PV systems will
eventually have a significant, but not an overwhelming, edge over the best
small thermal systems for low-head operation. Since PV systems are
already a more mature produce, it seems unlikely that well optimised
small thermal systems will become available before the expected
reductions in PV cell costs are realised. The best SCC assumptions for
small thermal systems are far more speculative than those used for PV
systems, since they assume such requirements as a reliable low cost
tracking system, etc.
However, the thermal systems cost analysis assumed operation with a positive
displacement pump, which at low heads would probably be no more
than 30% efficient. At higher heads, where a positive displacement pump
could be 7040% efficient, the SCC for small thermal systems is quite
likely to be lower than that for low-head PV systems. Further, PV systems
for higher heads would be relatively more complicated, requiring positive
displacement pumps with reduction gearing, plus power conditioning
electronics to obtain good optimisation, or multi-stage turbine pumps
driven by a long shaft from the surface, or a submersible multistage
turbine pump (which would require an extremely reliable brushlessm otor
to be practical). These extra complications would if anything substantially
increase the SCC for higher head PV systems as compared with low head
ones.
In other words, low head operation seems to favour PV systems, while
higher heads seem to favour thermal (assuming suitable thermal systems
are developed). However, high head operation (over IOm) was outside the
scope of the first Phase of this Project and further investigation would be *
needed to arrive at a reliable conclusion.
So far analyses have only considered “conventional” PV and thermal
small-scale pumping system technologies, in the sense that all systems
considered could be put together with existing components. What
cannot considered or predicted is the possibility of new inventions in
either field radically altering the picture. Both fields offer scope for such
possibilities, and many claims are made for unconventional solutions.
Since the conventional technologies appear potentially capable of
becoming cost-effectivef or small-scalep umping, although they are some
way off at present, anything that offers any substantial improvement in
cost-effectivenessc ould hardly avoid being immediately within striking
distance of offering economic operation. The next chapter considers some
of the unconventional technologies which just might overtake the
approachesd escribedi n this and the previousc hapter, and somew hich
may be of general interest but which seem unlikely contenders for success
in this field.

6. OTHER SOLAR PUMPING SYSTEM OPTIONS
6.1 lWOllUCtlOIl
The pe two sections have described solar photovoltaic and solar thermal
pumping systems, which ‘are at present the only option: that have been demonstrated
either as ccmmerc$al products or which are sufficiently developed to be
closet o commerciaiisation.F or completenessa number of other developmentso r
potential methods for converting solar energy into pumped water power are considered
below. Some of these techniques do not appear to have any future for
smallscale solar pumping systems, but others may, with further development,
prove to havez dvantagcso ver the systemsa vailablea t present.
6.2 -limmo.electIic Generators
Tbeae devices utilise the Seebeck Effect in which an e.m.f. is produced when the
junctions of a circuit made of suitable dissimilar metals are maintained at different
temperatures, a principle that has been widely used for temperature measurements
in certain types of thermocouple and for working thermostatic switches.
At least two manufacturersp roducec ommercial thermo-electricg enerators( Global
Thermoelectric Power Systems Limited (Canada) and Teledyne Energy Systems
Inc. (USA)), but both these systems are intended for ultra-reliable, virtually zeromaintenance
power generation in remote areas with heating provided by propane
gas in cylinders; neither supplier offers solar powered systems.
Like photovoltaic devices, the thermo-electric generator is a solid state device with
no moving parts and consequently can be expected to have a long working life
and to be very reliable. Tropane heated units have been claimed to be 4 to 6%
effh5ent and to work without any maintenance or attention for periods of up to
six yearsa t a time and to havea useful life of many decadesT. ypical power outputs
are in the 10 to 300W range which would be appropriate for the end use being
studied. Considerable work is believed to have been completed in the USSR on
thermalectric generation using solar heating and typical system efficiencies of 1
to 4% have been reported, with considerable improvement thought to be possible,
(Reference 36).
Thermoelectric generatorsr equire high temperatureo peration (over SOOOCa)n d
therefore most experimental examples tested with solar power are mounted at the
focus of a parabolic dish concentrating collector. As with high temperature heat
engines, they are therefore dependent on the use of reiiable and economic high
temperature tracking concentrators and require regular direct sunshine.
Their costs at present do not appear to make them competitive with photovoltaic
systems.

These involve heating a suitable electronemitting cathode surface in a vacuum or
low pressureio nised gas;e lectronsa re driven off and collected by a cold anode
placed very close to the cathode. The principle is much the same as in a thermionic
diode or valve( tube). Becausev ery high temperaturesa re required (over lOOOoC),
there doesn ot seemt o be much potential for their use for small-scales olar pumpb.
Brayton (Gas Turbine) SoIar ThennaI Systems
This process involves the continuous compression, heating and then expansion of
a gas( as in a conventional gas turbine). It is mentioned for completenessb ut
appearst o have no potential for small-scales olar pumping becauseo f the high
temperaturesr equired and the practical problemsa ssociatedw ith small turbines.
Photochemkal systems
Ordinary plant growth by photosynthesis is the prime example of a photochemical
system which forms the basis of all life on earth and which also formed most
of our fossil fuels. Natural biomass utilisation is outside the scope of this project,
but a synthetic photochemical processw hich showss ome promisei s the photoelectrolysiso
f water, in which sunlight is used,i n the presenceo f various catalysts,
to.break water down into its constituent components of hydrogen and oxygen,
which could then be used to power a fuel cell, or an engine.
It is too early to give any kind of fii estimate of the future potential of the catalytic
photo-electrolysis of water process and artificial photosynthesis is even
further from practical realisation at present, but if and when it is successfuilt
could revolutionise the use of solar energy.
Improved Efficiency Photovoltaic Technology
Apart from the development of Cadmium Sulphide and Gallium Arsenide cells
ah&y referred to in Chapter 4, a number of other innovative developments
are in hand to improve the efficiency of conversiono r cost-effectivenesosf photovoitaic
cells but none is believed to be at ali close to commercialisation as yet.
These methods include:
0 Separation of incident light into wavelength bands which are then applied
to photovoltaic devices chosen for their sensitivity to each band, giving
overall efficiencies of up to 50%.
ii) Vertical multi-junction cell, in which conventional silicon cells are stacked
in such a way that light enterv parallel to the junctions. These offer the
possibility of efficienciesi n excesso f 20% and it hasb een claimed that
147
such cells are not so sensitive to reduction of performance under high
temperatures, hence they are better suited for use in concentrating photovoltaic
arrays of much higher potential efficiency than has so far been
possible.
iii) Thermophotovoltaic cell, in which sunlight is focussed onto a thermal
mass in an enclosure designed to maintain the thermal mass at a temperature
of 18OOoCA. layer of cooled photovoltaic silicon cells is arranged
behind the thermal mass and receives radiation at the wavelength corresponding
to an emitter at 18OOW, which happens to be the wavelength
to which silicon solar cells are particularly sensitive. In this way the relatively
broad solar spectrum is converted with reasonably high efficiency
to a much narrower wavelength band at which it can be converted with
high efficiency to electricity by silicon cells. An overall system efficiency
(solar radiation to electricity) of the order of 30 to 50% may thereby
be achieved.
If the expected future cost reductions in conventional photovoitaic cells materialise
then it is questionable whether any of these innovations will be economical!y
justified.
6.7 Memory Metal and other Solid-State Heat Engines
Various alloys, including one of nickel and titanium developed by the US Naval
Ordnance Laboratory called Nitinol, have the property that they deform easily
at low temperatures but return to their original shape with considerable force if
heated. Varicus simple heat engines have been demonstrated in which Nitinol
elements are lsed by being alternately heated and cooled between warm water and
air. So far ths techno!ogy is at an early stage and low efficiencies have been
reported. However, the rather small temperature differences required mean that it
may be possible for such a device to function with simple and low cost (per unit
area)c ollectors (e.g. possibly a solar pond) which may offset the disadvantageo f
low efficiency.
Differential expansion of dissimilar metal strips is also a potential source of power
from a low temperature heat source, but the efficiency is again likely to be very
low.
Rubber and other polymers have recently been shown to have similar properties
to Nitbinol and engines using these have been demonstrated in the laboratory.
However their efficiencies seem low and the are still at too early a stage in their
development for it to be clear whether they may eventually be either technically
or economically viable.
6.8 Osmotic PressureE ngines
In theory, thermal energy can be converted to mechanical energy for pumping by
an osmotic process.I n this process,a dilute solution, such as brackishw ater, is
distilled using solar heat into separate solvent and concentrate (e.g. distilled water
148
and saturated brine solution). The concentrated solution and solvent are then passed
into two chamberss eparatedb y a semi-permeablem embrane.T he resulting
osmotic pressures et up acrosst he membranei s very substantial( up to 380 atmospheres
in the case of concentrated brine and distilled water), and this pressure
could be used to drive a turbine or other mechanical device (see Reference 37).
Although the techniquesf or solar distillation are simple and well-established,it is
not thought thar any serious investigation into the feasibility of energy conversion
basedo n osmotic pressuresh as taken place.

APPENDIX 1
PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES OF COSTS OF SOLAR
PUMPING SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
1. Beckground
With the continuous escalation in the price of fossil fuels, and the anticipated
global shortage of oil, the attractions of solar energy have magnified enormously
over the last ten years. The American government gave a target in 1979 that renewable
energy sources must satisfy 20% of total U.S. energy needs by the year
2000, and naturally this gave much stimulus to the solar industry in the USA.
However,a ll this activity is not necessarilyb eneficial so far as the needso f develop
in countries are concerned. The US programmes are of national, political, and
military sigmticanee, and while the economic aspect is obviously important it
is not necessarilya ll important. The majority of the end uses,a nd the vastp urchasing
powers of the U.S. market are quite different from those of developing
countries. Therefore much of the development is high technology, large scale,
sophisticated, and in a country with an almost unlimited manufacturing base plus
the highly skilled maintenance follow up required.
Developing countries offer a complete and stark contrast to the USA. Technology
is limited, and so is the supply of technicians, the manufacturing base is small, only
fairly standard raw materiais are available (with imports of special items difticult
due to lack of foreign currency), quality control at manufacture snd after sales
ma+enance follow up is likely to be inadequate.
Manufacture of solar pumping systems in the developing countries, beneficial
though it might be, is therefore by no means an automatic spin-off from work
carried out in the industriahsed countries.
Fortunately there is a plus to this situation as well as a minus. Appropriate solar
pumping system technology must aim for maximum simplicity, which in turn
can lead to lowei prices and should give better reliability.
2. Cost end Market
Given a low enough cost there is undoubtedly a very large world wide demand for
reliable small-scales olar-poweredp umps for irrigation and water supply. While first
cost is not the only factor in the overall economic equation it is almost certainly
the most important. As mentioned earlier this can work in favour of the Project
sincel ow fmt cost impiies simplicity and small-size,w hich in turn implies a design
suitable for manufacture in the developing countries.
3. - Estimate of costs of quantity production of a 200 watt PV system
The simple type of sythen is assumed:
Array/DC Motor/Centrifugal Pump
A maximum power point tracker (MPPT) is also considered in case these turn out to be ’
cost-effestive. Cost estimates for quantity production in a developing country in 1984 are
made for each component as follows:
Modules from USA at 6 5 per peak watt
(At a later stage cells may be imported and built into modules in the developing
tiuntries -though the value added will be modes;)
50% added for packing, air freight, import hc’:‘. and iocal fabrication into arrays -
including provision for 2 axis adjustment. This gives $7.50 per watt.
.-
Assuming 50% wire to water efficiency, array must produce 400 Watts.
cost = $3000
MPPT
Initial import of 10 complete units plus 100 sets of components to the develop
ing country.
Deletion program increaseslo cal content to 100% as local componentsb ecome
available.
Cost taken as $200
w DC Motor,
Developing country will probably have to import (initially at least) copper wire
for windings, ball bearings, seals, permanent magnets and armature stampings.
Hopefully commutation will be brushless, position unclear at the moment.
Shaft, casing, and various other parts to be made in developing country.
Armature winding and motor assembly locally.
Total cost taken as $250
157
centrifugal Pump
Main casings( cast iron) and shaft produced in developingc ountry.
initial import, but later local production, of impeller (sintered metal or plastic),
and shaft seal (spring loaded graphite/steel), and plain bearings (probably sintered
metal).
Total cost taken as $300
Thus the target cost for the complete system is $3750
It should be stated that:
(a) The significance of the array cost as 80% of the overall price build up is
apparent even with cells purchased at $5, Y pk
(b) No attempt has been made to estimate installation costs since these by
their nature are site specific.
158
4. Estimate of costs of quantity production of the 200 Watt thermal system
A conventional design is assumed using a simple line-focussing low concentration tracking
collector with the Solar Pump Corporation system components taken as models for casting
the balance of the system. Cost estimates for quantity production in the developing country
in 1984 for each component as follows:
(9 Collector
Copper pipe, reflectors and tracking unit for concentrator probably imported.
Steel framing, insulation and overall fabrication assumed available in developing
country.
Given some efficiency increase from development work up to 1984, area for 200
watts peak pumping power could be about I Om’
Taking $150 per square metre, (compared with current U.S. manufacturer’s price
of S 120/m’ including tracker)
Cost = $1500
(ii). Main Frame
Fabricated from local standard stock steel, and including provision for mounting
of collector and tracker.
Cost taken as 8400
(ii) Freon Engine & Valve
Main rubber diaphragm, various seals, and some small components imported,
initially at least.
Main housing, piston rod, piston rod guide etc, and most kralvep arts cast and
machined in developing country.
Cost taken as $350

Thus the target cost for the complete system is S3600. It should be noted that:-

production in Las Vegas of their flat plate collector, but otherwise
similar system.

(b) No figure is included for site preparation, foundation work, etc.
The assembly figure (8 250) covers the assembly and pipe

Cd It is felt that considerable design, development, and test work
will be necessaryb efore any sinall thermal system is suitable
for quantity production, either in developing countries or in
industrialised countries.

GENERAL RECOhlMENDATlONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SMALLSCALE
SOLAR PUMPXNG SYSTEMS*
1 Applications
Small-scale solar pumps for irrigation purposes are more likely to be successful if
they are:
0 applied in aress where irrigation has been traditionally practised, so that
it is only the use of the novel pump technology and not irrigation per se
that has to be taught
0 sized for small land holdings of the order of 0.5 ha.. for which they are
most competitive with the alternatives
0 first promoted in areas which need to be irrigated over most of the year
and where multiple cropping might be prsctised io order to achieve a good
year-round load factor for the solar pump
0 preferably restricted, at least initially, to pumping static heads of no
more than around 5m (and IOm at the very highest), implying a system
output of the order of 100 to 300W peak of hydraulic power for a land
area of 0.5 ha.
0 used generally in areas where the provision of fuel for engines is proving
increasingly difficult and costly and where mains electric power is absent.
It should be noted that the first costs of the more cost-effective of the present
generation of pumps are still at least double that of systems which would represent
an economic investment when used for irrigation. The aspect is discussed fully in
the Technical and Economic review.
Small-scale solar pumps should also be considered for application to non-irrigation
purposes such as village or livestock water supp::zs, which offer a better load factor
(demand being more or less constant all the year around). Another point of fundamental
importance is that the price which water can command for domestic
purposes is considerably higher than for irrigation. It was beyond the scope of the
project so far to investigate these other end-uses but it is expected that solar pumps
would be viable at a much higher head (perhaps up to 20m) for this kind of application.
2 Photovoltaic System Spe&ication
As a result of the studies completed under this project, it is possible to
produce an outline specification for a small-scale PV pumping system for
irrigation at low heads, that ought to be competitive with small engine
powered pumps in many parts of the world.
It must be stressed that this is not the ultimate type of design that is to be
recommended, but the logical next step incorporating the principal lessons
learnt so far in using present day equipment. It is to be expected, of
course, that innovative developments in the technology will introduce
new options in the near ftiture that are no? considered here, but which
have been discussed in the Project Record and in the Technical and
Economic Review accompanying this Report.
l A copy of Chaprer I 1 ‘Design Recommendations’ from the ‘Project Report
163
iii) System Efficiency Requirement
Optimum system efficiency targets should be set as follows for the next
generation of pumping systems:
array cells 11% at 25’C (10% at NOCT)
connections 95%
motor 85%
pump 55%
pipework 95%
total for system 4.6% (based on array cell area)
This is equivalent to the very best systems so far tested. Any power con-.
ditioner or other such accessories that consume power, should provide
benefits to more than compensate for their cost and power consumption.
iv) _ Design Point to be observed
In preparing designs to meet performance specifications of the type outlined
in 11.2.2 and the target efficiences set out in 11.2.3, it is recommended
that manufacturers pay due regard to the following practical
design points. These are not listed with the intention of inhibiting future
development in any way, but as a convenient resume of the main lessons
learnt during Phase I of the Project.
a) Genera! Requirements
0 the system should either be fully portable and mounted
on skids or wheels or it should be fixed. In the latter
case the array should ba mounted at least 1.5m above
ground level and bolted to not more than two concrete
foundation blocks; the holding down bolts to be positioned
to an accuracy no better than 25mm, to allow
for errors in the positioning of the foundations.
0 systems should be designed to survive particular local
climatic conditions. In areas prone to typhoons or hurricanes
it may be necessary to provide for the rapid dismantling
and removal to safety of the array.
0 pumps and motors should be provided with sun-shades
whenever possible, but be well ventilated if air-cooled.
0 materials exposed to solar radiation (such as plastics)
should have proven durability.
0 modules should be individually packed to avoid damage
in transit. No single package for the system should exceed
Im x 2m or a weight of 50kg. Safety of contents
should not be dependent on being stored any particular
way up or on receiving special handling treatment.

0 detailed instructions should be provided, in the local
language, for the correct assembly of the system. Also
included should be a components list, maintenance and
operating instructions and guidance on how to achieve
the best output (eg, not using small bore pipes or
restricting fittings, not allowing shadows to fall on
the array). All documentation should be written in
simple terms.
0 the need for routine maintenance lubrication and readjustments
(eg, belt-drives and waterseal packing)
should b,e minimised and avoided if possible.
Array and Module Requirements
lifetime guarantee of say 5 years against faulty quality
with no more than 10% degradation of performance to

resistive losses at full power to no more than 5%;
blocking diodes (if required) should result in no more
than 2% loss at full power.
array nominal voltage under peak sunlight conditions
should be around 8OV: higher voltages will not be safe,
while lower voltages will mean higher currents and larger
resistive losses.
165
0 electronics power conditioners (or other electronic
‘circuitry) should be fully ‘tropicalised’ and should use
components to tropical ambient temperature specifications.
Full protection by automatic cut-out against
excessive temperature, voltage or current, (prefer
automatic reset).
0 quality assurance and testing to be to a satisfactory
standard and specified by the manufacturer.

length specified for head and site.
3 ‘Ihenna System Development
FolIowing the laboratory tests of thermal systems, the system design studies, and
the installation in the field of a complete system, definite recommendations for the
development of small-scale solar-thermal water pumping systems can be made.
The continued development of solar-thermal systems should be encouraged in
particular to demonstrate small-scale systems utilizing concentrating solar
collectors with organic Rankine cycle engines or high temperature air Stirling cycle
enpines.
Existing working systems have been shown to have the potential for quantity production
at costs comparable with the present costs of photovoltaic systems. Further
development of these type of systems is justified if significant future reductions
in the cost of photovolaics is in doubt in which case development should be
encouraged to improve the reliability and performance in order to achieve designs
more appropriate to the proposed use.
Further work is required in order to broaden the limited scope of the present
thermal design studies and in particular to investigate the designs that have been
shown to have promise for low cost manufacture.
167
Specific Capital Cost analysis on small thermal systems gave $1.5/kJ per’ ds.y for a
Freon vapour Rankine cycle engine with a one-axis tracking parabolic trough
(line-focus) colIector. A high temperature air Stirling cycle engine with a pointfocus,
tracking parabolic dish collector or central receiver collector also should be
further investigated as the Specific Capital Cost was determined as being even
lower. Components in this type of system are however less developed than those in
line-focus collector Rankine cycle engine systems
Components that may form part of an improved soiar-thermal system should be
evaluated and tested. Fur example an inexpensive reliable tracking mechanism
for a s&r collector needs to be investigated.
Improved systems wIIl need thorough laboratory tests followed by field trials.
This wIII also improve the data base for development of the mathematical model.
The sizing of thermal systems needs further study to improve Specific Capital
Costs. This is more size dependant for thermal systems than for photovoltaics.

Smali-ScaleS olar-PoweredIr rigation PumpingS ystems:
Phase I Project Report
EXECUTXVE SUMMARY
1. INTRODUCl-ION
1.1 Purpose and Background
The Project was funded by the UNDP and executed by the World Bank. The
Consultants appointed to implement the technical work were Sir William Halcrow
&Partners working in association with the intermediate Technology Development
Group (both of London, UK). Phase I of the Project commenced in July 1979
and lasted until May I98 1.
The main purpose of Phase I of the Project has been to demonstrate and evaluate
the useo f solar energy for powering small-scalep umping systemst o be usedf or
irrigation on typical small land holdings in developing countries, with a view to
recommending how the technology should develop.
In this connection, “small” land holdings refers to the millions of intensely
cultivated land holdings farmed by poorer farmers in many developing countries,
the majority of which have areas of around one hectare or less requiring, typically,
about 50m of water per day per hectarei n the irrigation seasonT. he hydraulic
power output required to pump such daily volumes from depths of typically Sm,
will be of the order of IOO-300W.
In’order to evaluate pumps for this duty, considerable practical work was required,
including field trials of systemsa nd laboratory testing of subsystemsa nd components,
followed by an analytical system design study.
As a result of this work, the likely performance to be expected from small-scale
solar pumps as the technology matures has been determined with some precision.
The advantageas nd disadvantageos f different technical options haveb eens tudied
and indications obtained about the desirable features to be developed for smallscale
irrigation pumping systems.
Some forecasts of the likely price trends and of the factors that affect the
economics of such systems have also been made.
During the course of the Project, much useful experience was gained about the
proceduresn ecessaryfo r testing the equipment in the field and laboratory and for
data collection and reporting. Valuable lessonsw ere also learnt about the collaborative
relationships which need to be established with the co-operating agencies
in the host countries and these will be useful to future phases of this Project.
1.2 Reports

which were reached as a result of the work done in Phase I. An accompanying

Powered Irrigation Pumping Systems: Technical and Economic Review”.
Phase I of the project conveniently breaks down into three principal components -
field trials, laboratory testsa nd systemd esigns tudies-andth is is the generalf ormat
of the Project Report and of the summary which follows.
2. FIELDTRIALS
2.1 Objectives
The main objectives of the field trials were:
I. To obtain fmt hand, reliable and objective performance data for existing
systemsu nder field conditions as a prerequisite for assessingh ow the
technology should be improved.
2. To gain experience with the management of field testing, data collection
and analysis and reporting.
3. To demonstrate the technology in countries typical of those in which
solar pumping may have widespread future application as a preliminary to
technology transfer, and to highlight the aspects which most urgently
require attention.
4. . To provide data for the validation of the mathematical model built as part
of the system design studies.
The DNDP selected Mali, Philippines and Sudan to participate in the field trials.
The Consultants collaborated with the Solar Energy Laboratory in Mali, the
Center for NonConventional Energy Development in Philippines, and the Institute
of Energy Researchin Sudan.
2.2 Selection of Equipment
The Consultantsr eviewedt he availability of small-scales olar pumps suitable for the
purposes of the Project. 250 questionaires were sent to potential suppliers throughout
the world. However, although many countries have significant R & D
pmgrammes. few suppliers were in a position to offer adequately developed
systems to satisfy the selection criteria and within the delivery schedule demanded
by the Project.
The selection criteria required equipment with the correct delivery for the head
specified, typically in the range I to 3 litrelsec through a static head of 5 to IOm
under peak sunlight conditions. Also, systems were required to be robust and
172
practical. have low maintenance requirements, be efficient and preferably have
some promise of capability of manufacture in developing countries. The required
delivery time was I3 weeks from time of order.
Only 13 suppliers were able to offer equipment that appeared suitable and a short
list was prepared for approval by the World Bank. Finally, IO different systems
were purchased, nine photovoltaic (PV) and one thermal. One PV system was
duplicated and so 1 I systems in all were purchased for the field trials. In addition,
permission was given to monitor an existing system already installed and
working in Mali, but not purchased by the Project.
The 12 systems monitored, their respective costs (including air freight to host
country), locations and the volume of data collected for them are indicated in
Table I.
2.3 Field Programme and Progress
The field programmes in each country were supported by Resident Engineers
(RE’s), one in each country, posted by the Consultants to assist the national
institution install the equipment and to advise the local engineers and technicians
in its use and in the monitoring procedures. The RE’s had previously visited the
manufacturers of the systems they were to install to inspect the equipment prior to
despatch and to receive instruction and advice.
The principal parameters measured in the field were concerned with performance
assessment, both instantaneously through continuous monitoring of key variables
(such as irradiance in the p!ana of the array, photovoltaic array electrical power
output and pumped warer rlow rare) using cnart recorders and cumulatively, by
daily readings of inputs and outputs (such as solar energy input during the whole
day, electrical energy generated and total quantity of water pumped) registered on
totalizers.
In the event, the recording of field data presented some difficulties: technically
with the pumping systems and to a lesser extent, with the instruments; and
logistically with late deliveries by the manufacturers, damaged key items, and difficulty
in arranging transport to the sites. The short time scale of Phase I also
created other problems: equipment could only be ordered in January 1980, testing
commenced mainly between June and September 1980, and the RE’s left their
countries by September 1980 (returning briefly later in December 1980 and/or
January 1981). Despite these matters, the field trials programme was substantially
completed by the end of Phase 1.
Of the 12 systems monitored, 10 yielded sufficient continuous data to determine
their performance, while two systems could not be tested at all; in one~case (a PV
system) this was because of delays in arrival of parts and damage in’transit! while
in the other (the thermal system) technical problems prevented the pump from
running for periods long enough for its performance to be determined (though
these defects were of a kind which, given time, should be solvable) Of the IO PV
systems from which data were obtained, one borehole pumping system performed
almost faultlessly for the whole of the trial period. A number of problems afflicted
173
other PV systems including, for example, two systems with poor suction performance
(even under high level; oi irradiance), two systems with unreliable
footvalves (leading to pumps being difficult to prime or running dry), two systems
with wrong wiring or poor connnections (leading to low power output, from the
arrays), one system with an impeller binding on the pump casing and two systems
with unreliable electronics (leading to complete failure). Some faults were repaired
in situ, while others required replacement part:. The proolrms involving poor
suction and impeller binding were not resolved within the time scale of Phase I of
the Project.
2.4 Conclusions from Field Trials
Table II indicates the principal results obtained from testing all the systems. The
maximum instantaneous system efficiency (based on array area) recorded was just
over 3%. However, most of the adequately reliable systems were typically 2%
efficient and the poorer systems only returned optimum efficiencies of around 1%.
Referenced to gross cell area, the maximum system efficiency was just over 4%.
Clearly, there is considerable variability in efficiency between different systems,
and since the efficiency dictates the size of array necessary for a given output, and
array costs dominate, overall efficiency has a major effect on equivalent annual
costs.
From an operational viewpoint, the main conclusion was that pumps have to be
self-priming, that is, they must be able to start pumping without any need for
operator intervention. Non-self priming pumps, if emptied of water due to, say, a
leaking footvalve, cannot refill themselves and therefore will simply run dry,
overheat and may suffer serious damage.
Wherever possible, centrifugal pumps should be of the immersed type and so
dispense with troublesome and energy consuming footvalves. If surface-mounted
self-priming centrifugal suction pumps have to be used, care should also be taken to
see that the suction head remains moderate.
Numerous relatively minor problems Yere experienced with many of the systems;
for example:
incorrect wiring supplied
terminals that did not readily give good electrical connection
faiiure of electronic circuitry (due either to overheating or to overload)
possibility of safety hazard due to dangerous dc voltages
broken module cover glasses (both in transit and on site)
suction pi$ework trapping air in cavities
footvalves jamming or leaking
inadequate packing for shipping
It was felt, however, that these problems were not fundamental to the technology
and can be overcome during the normal course of development as the technology
matures. Certainly, the systems have the potential for reliable operation with minimum
maintenance. Regular maintenance jobs should be minimized and made easy
to carry out.

3. LABORATORY TESTS
3.1 Objectives
The main objectives of the laboratory testing programme were:
(1) To determine independently the true performance characteristics of
selected solar pumping subsystems and components under controlled
conditions at full and part-load.
(2) To provide data for the system design studies to enable improved solar
pumping systems to be developed.
(3) To help identify the causes of good or bad field-tested system
performance.
(4) To provide limited indications of the basic reliability and durability of
certain components.
Generally, the component testing programme was designed to investigate performance
(i.e., output and efficiency characteristics) rather than reliability or
quality. Hence, single items were tested in the case of PV sub systems (motors and
pumps) and of thermal systems, but for the reasons given below, five examples of
each selected PV module were tested.
The testing programme breaks down into three principal areas of investigation:
PV modules, PV subsystems (motor and pump) and thermal systems.
3.2 PV Modules
The choice of PV modules was limited to those which had not been independently
tested and publicly reported and which displayed interesting features - technical
(e.g. high packing density for cells), commercial (e.g. low cost) or others, such as a
product made in India which was indicative of what might readily be manufactured
in a developing country. All cells were of the mono-crystalline silicon type. Since
these are particularly expensive components which are required to be durable,
robust and long-lasting, five examples of each module were purchased for a more
detailed investigation of quality and performance. Details of products tested are
given in Table III.
The modules were performance tested independently by the Royal Aircraft
Establishement (RAE) in the U.K. and by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in
the U.S.A. RAE carried out oerformance tests and ultra-violet accelerated ageing
tests and JPL carried out their standard performance and durability testing (a
routine generally applied by JPL for the US Department of Energy to most
American PV modules). Both testing organizations carried out visual inspections
and reported on the condition of the modules before and after testing. The results
obtained by each of the organizations for the maximum power output of the same
module were very close (average value differed by 0.5%).
175
3.3 PV Subsystems
The University of Reading in the UK tested pump and motor units from all the PV
systems purchased for testing in the field. In addition a selection of four further
pumps and two motors were tested. The extra pumps were chosen as representing
generic types of pump not otherwise included in the programme but of possible
interest for the future design of pumping systems. These included a free-diaphragm
pump, a rotary screw (or progressive cavity) pump, a piston pump and a selfpriming
centrifugal pump. The extra motors included a high efficiency industrial
permanent magnet dc motor, similar to those used on most of the subsystems, and
a reciprocating linear actuator. Details are given in Table III.
The main requirement of this testing programme was to obtain performance data
vital for the system design study over a wide range of full and part-load conditions
and typical of those existing in solar pumping applications. Components were also
visually inspected after testing to determine their general quality and suitability
for inclusion in small-scale irrigation pumping systems,
3.4 Thermal Systems
Virtually all thermal systems were of prototype status - only one such system could
be purchased for field trials and even this was not a mature product. The only
system which could readily be transported for laboratory testing at the University
of Reading was a Stirling cycle solar pump, under development in the USA. Hence
the only generally practicable way to gain an insight into thermal system
performance and potential was to witness testing at the manufacturers’ own test
facilities; hence arrangements were made for the Consultants’ engineers to monitor
tests of three systems under development in Israel, Germany and the U.S.A.
Although other systems were known to be under development, it was only possible
to make arrangements for those listed in Table III.
3.5 Conclusions of Laboratory Testing
The objectives of the laboratory testing programme were generally achieved, with
reports of completed tests on all of the equipment.
Modules
The performances of the PV modules were consistently below their manufacturers’
specifications, by from 2%0/oto I6H%. This has serious implications in view of their
high cost (S IO to S20 per peak Watt) and because accurate performance knowledge
is necessary for good system design. Cell efficiency varied by over 20%
between the best and worst products tested.
Although only one PV module actually failed under the durability testing
programme, all products displayed minor flaws or design faults and one or two
had potentially serious shortcomings,
Although it is considered that the levels of efficiency ( IO%+). high quality and long
life often claimed for PV arrays in the technical press and in manufacturers’
literature are obtainable, such a standard of performance of most currently
available products cannot be taken for granted at present.
176
Motors
The dc motors tested were all permanent magnet machines* of generally high
efficiency. Nevertheless a spread of about 15% in optimum efficiency (75 to 87%)
was found between the best and the worst performers. This difference can be
worth more than the total cost of a motor in terms of extra array costs (at present
day prices). Clearly, PV solar pumping systems should use motors of better than
85% optimum efficiency, so long as the cost of PV arrays is dominant.
Considerable variability in pump performance was revealed. The best centrifugal
pumps were over 50% efficient under optimum operating conditions, while many
were only 30 to 40% efficient. A few were less than 20% efficient. It is clear that
the choice of pump can be perhaps the single most influential factor in good smallscale
solar PV pumping system design. From the system design studies it was found
that overall system efticiencies for systems using centrifugal pumps were sensitive
to head variation, and it is clearly important to seek pumps whose drop in
efficiency when operating away from their optimum head is as small as possible.
This objective will help to maintain acceptable performance for situations where
the actual head does not coincide with the optimum for the pump or where the
head varies either seasonally or due to well draw-down.
Nevertheless, centrifugal pumps appear to be the most promising type of pump
for the low head applications (< 1 Om head) demanded for irrigation, although selfpriming
capability is essential for practical field use. Positive displacement piston
pumps offer good performance (better than 50%) at higher heads Q 10m). They
are also relatively insensitive to variations in head or to operating off their
optimum head.
Thermal Systems
The performance of the Stirling engine pumping system was disappointing and it
failed mechanically partway through the test series. The other systems, all Rankine
cycle using Freon type working fluids, performed in line with our expectations and
gave overall efficiencies of between 1% and 2%. Examples seem some distance from
commercial viability (with the possible exception of the system purchased for field
testing), but our system studies showed that this technology could be competitive
with PV systems, given suitable development and high volume production.
The system design studies showed that thermal systems would be likely to improve
in both efficiency and in cost-effectiveness if tracking concentrating collectors were
used instead of the fixed flat plate collectors of the Rankine cycle systems so far
tested. Consideration would need to be given to the maintenance requirements
which this would impose.

4. SYSTEM DESIGN STUDIES
4.1 Objectives
The purpose of the system design studies was to investigate whether, and in what
ways, small-scale solar pumping systems might be improved for irrigation purposes
and to see whether the specification of an improved system could be developed.
This was achieved by examining the cost-effectiveness of a number of technically
Feasible system options under a variety of operating conditions. For all systems,
computer-based mathematical modelling techniques were used to simulate the performance
and cost of the main components of both PV and thermal systems.
4.2 Models
The PV systems model was developed using data from the laboratory testing
programme, validated by comparison with the field performance data obtained
For complete systems. Factors that were investigated are listed in Table IV. A
special parameter, the Specific Capital Cost (the capital cost per unit energy output
per day in US S per k.I) was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of the alternative
system options examined. For this purpose “normalized” costs were used to
give a measure of the capital cost of a different systems, excluding arbitrary factors
which may influence the price of individual items.
A simple thermal system model was also produced to investigate the general merits
of different thermal system concepts (i.e., the use of different types of solar
collector, thermal cycle, working fluid and expander). The Specific Capital Cost
was also used to express and compare the cost-effectiveness of thermal systems.
Finally, a simple economic model For PV systems was constructed to investigate
the sensitivity of typical PV solar systems to variations in selected economic and
technical parameters (discount rate, life, differential movement in real prices) and
to compare solar pumping system costs with those of small engine-powered
pumping systems. The model calculated the present value of the various cash flow
streams. This work is reported in detail in the separate “Technical and Economic
Review” volume.
4.3 Conclusions
PV systems
Significant performance and cost-reducing improvements appear to be readily
obtainable with PV systems at the existing level of technology developed from~
those tested under the programme so far. In particular overall efficiency can be
improved by:
0 the use of pumps whose efficiency change with head over the likely
working head range is as small as possible.
0 optimisation of the proportion oFPV cells that were connected in parallel
and series within the module. (One system supplied was almost perfectly
optimised, but with another an improvement of 13% in overall system
efficiency could be achieved).
178
0 varying the array power to find the optimum value: in one case the
Specific Capital Cost dropped by 19% when the array power was increased
by 60%, due to a substantial increase in output and efficiency.
0 the use of a Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT)*. This was
investigated and may have little or no benetit on well-matched systems
but would be expected to improve less well-matched systems under
varying climatic and head conditions. Pumped daily water output was increased
typically by 15% on a clear day and by 25% on a hazy day
through the use of a MPPT.
0 using movable or tracking PV arrays. The increase in output obtained by
a perfectly tracked array (over a fixed array) was compared with the
increases obtained by arrays reoriented to preset positions once, twice
or three times in a day and reset in the evening. It was found that reorentation
twice daily allows the use of 95% of the energy received by a
continuously tracked array. It is doubtful therefore whether the extra cost
and complication of a continuously tracking system can be justified for
applications such as inigation.
0 care in specifying pipework for systems. The pipework necessary to
connect the pump with the source and to deliver water to the point of
application is a simple, but vitally important, part of the solar pumping
system. The Specific Capital Cost was minimized for the particular
conditions of the tests: it is unlikely that a pipe diameter less than SO mm
should ever be used. The use of inadequate pipe diameters can
dramatically reduce the system efficiency and increase the Specific Capital
cost.
The combined result of a number of these improvements for one system is shown
in Table V.
In general, the Consultants consider it is feasible to produce small-scale solar pump
ing systems having overall instantaneous system efficiencies above 4% (some of the
systems tested were only around 2% efficient). Specific Capital Costs of around
$2.5 kJ** per day should be possible (at present day prices with +rrent zchnology)
compared to a range of 63.1 to S9.8 obtained from model tests on the
systems purchased. If PV array prices fall to about 50% of their current lowest level
(i.e. reach S 4/W peak) then the Specific Capital Cost of g 2S/kJ per day will
reduce to about g 1.0 yielding water at about one third the cost of the most costefficient
systems currently available.
Thermal Systems
Data on thermal systems were restricted in scope and quality compared with the
PV data, but nevertheless clear conclusions emerged from the studies which analysed
over 30 different system options. The principal one is that high temperature
* A Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) is an electronic control device which
continuously adjusts the array voltages to an optimum value to maxim&e the
power output from the array. Its main benefit is increased system efficiency and
output, but it also consumes a proportion of the power produced by the array
and it can be an expensive component adding significantly to system first costs.
** The unit kilojoule has been used because it is a basic SI unit of energy and
because it gives convenient dollar numbers. There are 3600 kJ in one kWh.

thermal systems using concentrating collectors appear to be significantly
more cost-effective than low temperature flat plate collector systems, mainly
on account of the much smaller collector areas required to yield a given output.
The least cost-effective approach appears to be precisely the one favoured by
most current manufacturers (fixed flat plate collectors); the indications are that a
system using a linear-focussing equatorially-tracking collector would be about 30
to 40% less expensive, lvhile even higher concentration through the use of a power
tower or point focus two-axis tracking collector could result in some slight further
improvement in cost effectiveness. Some uncertainties lie in the assumptions concerning
the likely costs of tracking mechanisms, but the results are nevertheless
significant enough to justify serious study of the use of concentrating and tracking
thermal concentrators, and the more complex maintenance requirements this
would impose.
Specific Capital Cost analysis on small thermal systems gave S2.8/kJ per day for
a typical flat plate collector system (similar to the one tested) and S I.5 for a
Freon vapour Rankine cycle engine with a one-axis tracking parabolic trough (line
focus) collector: these costs appear to be competitive with PV systems. Thus it
would be premature to dismiss thermal systems at this stage.

OBJECTIVES OF AND PREPARATION FOR PHASE II OF THE PROJECT*
The next phase of the Project, Phase II preparation, provides a period in which to
reflect on the results obtained from Phase I, to confm the objectives of Phase II,
and to make the necessaryp reparationsf or it.
The Consultants think it important to use this period to review the applications,
economics and system sizes of solar pumps. As far as applications are concerned,
it will be necessaryto review the conditions under which solar pumps will be
suitable for irrigation purposes and to evaluate in detail the potentially more
attractive water supply application. The economic criteria to be satisfied by the
pumps will need to be examined in more detail and the relative economic merits of
other lifting devicesw ill need to be assesseds,o that solar pumps are only demonstrated
where there are good propects for their technical and economic viability. It
will also be necessaryto study and defiie the pumping requirements( head, flow
and pattern of consumption) in order to build up a profile of market requirements
for each application.
