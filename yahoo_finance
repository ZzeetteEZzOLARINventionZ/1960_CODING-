Hi Chandoo,


 Below is a link to a free excel spreadsheet I downloaded, from the net as a free excel spreadsheet (ie stock screener), which has the necessary vba code to download stock data to excel, by extracting data from Yahoo & finviz sites. However I would like to know if this is possible to get the same data on Australian stocks only from Yahoo. As the currently data only has information for about 11 AU stocks on the finviz site, the rest are mainly us /other country stocks. I sent an email to Samir Khan who created the file/code two weeks ago, but to date I have not had a reply.


 The link is : http://investexcel.net/2487/stock-screener-excel/#comment-3819.


 Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Hi ,


 I did not receive a reply to my above email does anyone know how to extract the same stock data for Australian stocks from Yahoo, in regards to the excel spreadsheet and associated VBA code via the following link: http://investexcel.net/2487/stock-screener-excel/#comment-3819.


 Which extracts data on only 11 au stocks, the rest are US and International stocks.

The VBA project in the workbook is password protected so I am unable to see or amend the code. Sorry

Hi, ballterrier!


 Perhaps you want to give a look at these links (there are many other written by me, just use the search feature at top right of the page, Google button):

 http://chandoo.org/forums/topic/macros-web-query-huge-headache-can-anyone-help-me

 http://chandoo.org/forums/topic/specific-data-and-html-beyond-excels-capabilities


 So if you have the actual URL of the pages from where you want to download the data maybe you can adapt the file of the link of another similar.

There are ways to remove the password:

Hi Ballterrier


 The spreadsheet you have provided a link to only obtains data from Finviz.com ("The data is downloaded from finviz.com into the “Data” sheet, and a filter table is automatically created.")


 However, I have a spreadsheet which does something similar to what you are asking for:




Code (vb):

http://rapidshare.com/files/3565076863/Share%20Trading.xlsm


 Wherever you have saved the file, ensure you also create a folder "Stocks", this is where the data will be saved.


 I obtained a complete list of shares from http://www.asx.com.au
, but I cannot remember where on that site exactly, but I am sure you will be able to find it.


 Yahoo finance requires the ASX code to have ".ax" at the end (i.e. BHP.AX). You will see the example list of stocks and how I have them organised. Hit create workbooks, and the historical data will flow in.


 This only provides historical data, looking at your link you are after much more, but I hope this gets you started.


 Cheers

Hi DaveTurton,


 I am only an old pensioner that does not know much about vba code or VBA Projects, the stock screener project is called Stock Screener.xls, which has no password on it ? The are seven vba modules as follows that are not locked:


 &#62; modExtractData

 &#62; modGetCSVFile

 &#62; modGetHTMLTable

 &#62; modGetYahooHistory

 &#62; modGetYahooQuotes

 &#62; Module1

 &#62; modUtilities.


 Don't you just need to look at the code in these to determine how the data is imported into Excel, which you can see all the code (ie not pass word protected) ?


 The only thing I can a password on is "ThisWorkbook", dos this mean that the Excel workbook is hidden and this what you want to look at ?


 How do I attached the Excel file to a comment post?


 Also Shaun thanks for your comments but the file you mentioned only has 3 columns which is too limiting.

Hi, ballterrier!

 The link that you posted from investexcel.net has the VBA project protected with password, so we can't do anything, at least legal.

 If you have a unprotected copy or a version of that file, give a look at the green sticky posts at this forums main page for uploading guidelines.

Hi Narayan,


 Yes the excel spreadsheet is the same, when you select f11 can you access the VBA code in the six VBA modules, or are they password protected. On my copy that I downloaded they are are not password protected.


 SirJB7, can you please use the url: http://justspreadsheets.blogspot.in/2009/12/stock-screening-in-excel.html. The only password I can see is one the workbook, but you only need to look at the vba code in the modules, to determine how download stock data from Yahoo instead of Finviz, for Australian stocks correct ?

Hi, ballterrier!


 The article from http://justspreadsheets.blogspot.in/2009/12/stock-screening-in-excel.html is of Dec 22nd 2009, and the link to the downloadable file from http://www.toteboard.net/Models/ZipFiles/StockScreener.zip is dated Jan 07th 2010.


 But I don't see any password at all, neither for the workbook nor worksheets nor VBA project, are you sure we're talking about the same version? If not fully sure, please grant access to your uploaded file at rapidshare.


 In the meanwhile I'll give a look at it and post here again.

Hi ,


 I downloaded the file ; it's a wonderful piece of work. Whether it is accurate or not , only those who trade in stocks can say.


Neither the workbook nor the sheets nor the VBA code is protected.


 But I am not sure who will take up the job of answering your question ; the code has been developed over a period of more than 2 years , and is over a 1000 lines ; I do not know who has the time or the inclination to go through the code , understand it , and then answer your question.


 Have you tried posting your question in the same forum viz.

Hi Narayan,


 Thanks for agreeing with me that the project is not password protected, and that VBA code in all six VBA modules can be accessed without restriction. Yes I did asked them the same queries I posted in this forum, in the http://justspreadsheets.blogspot.in/2009/12/stock-screening-in-excel.html forum, and got no response. Hence I posted in this forum to see if anyone could find a way to get the stock data on AU stocks instead of US/International stocks, from Yahoo finance or Google finance etc, instead of Finviz.


 Hi SirJB7,


 As Narayan has confirmed the file is not password protected, is possible for you obtain the file from the following url, as he did:

 I chose to pull out the data directly from Yahoo Finance for market Australia, as this was your original requirement and the embedded solution into the StockScreener file wasn't any simple to find.


 This is up to where I arrived. What you're gonna do with this (process it by yourself, build a new StockScreener, ...) it's beyond the scope of these macros. Hope it helps.


 Regards!


 PS: Despite of the fact that in this link:

 http://au.finance.yahoo.com/lookup/all?s=%2a&t=A&m=AU&r=&b=0 (1st) or in:

 http://au.finance.yahoo.com/lookup/all?s=%2a&t=A&m=AU&r=&b=1000 (last)

 it says "All(5XXX)" that number isn't correct as for Australia there're just up to 1020 which could be checked manually pressing "Next" in previous link.

Hi SirJB7,


 The above file.code does achieve what I was looking for, it only provides Stock Code, Name and last trade details, not details of data for the 81 columns listed in the Stockscreener spreadsheet. Does the code for this spreadsheet only extract the codes and stock names from Google finance, then goes to Finviz to extract the data for the 81 columns into the spreadsheet? If so I guess the same data will not be possible from Google finance.


 My other query is the number of stocks listed does not appear to be correct states 1020, but as far as I know there should be at least 2045, refer: http://www.asx.com.au/asx/research/listedCompanies.do.


 I did a little more research on what data google provides, details are:


 s - Symbol

 n - Name

 l - Last Trade (With Time)

 l1 - Last Trade (Price Only)

 d1 - Last Trade Date

 t1 - Last Trade Time

 k3 - Last Trade Size

 c - Change and Percent Change

 c1 - Change

 p2 - Change in Percent

 t7 - Ticker Trend

 v - Volume

 a2 - Average Daily Volume

 i - More Info

 t6 - Trade Links

 b - Bid

 b6 - Bid Size

 a - Ask

 a5 - Ask Size

 p - Previous Close

 o - Open

 m - Day's Range

 w - 52-week Range

 j5 - Change From 52-wk Low

 j6 - Pct Chg From 52-wk Low

 k4 - Change From 52-wk High

 k5 - Pct Chg From 52-wk High

 e - Earnings/Share

 r - P/E Ratio

 s7 - Short Ratio

 r1 - Dividend Pay Date

 q - Ex-Dividend Date

 d - Dividend/Share

 y - Dividend Yield

 f6 - Float Shares

 j1 - Market Capitalization

 t8 - 1yr Target Price

 e7 - EPS Est. Current Yr

 e8 - EPS Est. Next Year

 e9 - EPS Est. Next Quarter

 r6 - Price/EPS Est. Current Yr

 r7 - Price/EPS Est. Next Yr

 r5 - PEG Ratio

 j3 - Market Cap (Real-time)

 r2 - P/E (Real-time)

 c8 - After Hours Change (Real-time)

 i5 - Order Book (Real-time)

 x - Stock Exchange


 However apparently there are limitations, you can only use ten of the above tags at a time, and a maximum of 200 stocks. So does this mean you would have to code to loop multiple times to collect data for all stocks (eg 2045 odd) and all 60 plus stock tags.


 What I wanted the coded to do is :

 (1) Have list box display all the AU indices linked urls (apparently there are 47), refer url: 

 http://au.finance.yahoo.com/lookup/indices;_ylt=Am3b6VWQZ6n.ol_m9uJx1wBHW49G;_ylu=X3oDMTFjdGY5NWQ1BHBvcwM1BHNlYwN5ZmlTeW1ib2xMb29rdXBSZXN1bHRzBHNsawNpbmRpY2Vz?s=*&t=I&m=AU&r=


 (2) When you select an index url I would like the code to select all the stock codes for that index, then extract all the data for those stocks for the sixty odd yahoo tags for each stock into an excel spreadsheet.


 eg:


 (A) select ^AORD symbol, code would select component url: http://au.finance.yahoo.com/q/cp?s=%5EAORD to select all the stock codes for that indice,


 (B) the collate all the data for the 61 stock tags,


 (C) Extract the data to the excel spreadsheet,


 I would like to have this data to be able to measure the performance of stocks.


 I hope you can understand what I am saying.


 Regards,


 Ron.

Hi, ballterrier!


 This is a major change of your original requirement and it seems that you actually need the features provided by Stock Screener and not only getting basic data from Yahoo Finance but from Finviz as well as your firstly asked for.


 As NARAYANK991 correctly stated the code behind Stock Screener is huge, not well documented, it has more than two or three years, and it'd be very hard first to understand it to then update it to meet your specifications. Speaking by myself this is a job far beyond what it could be done at this forums, at least it'd be so time consuming that deserves a dedicated consultant to do the job, whom should preferably had finance and Excel skills.


 My advise is:


 a) If you know what specific pages should be accessed at Yahoo site to retrieve the whole information you need, please post them here so as to evaluate the feasibility of adapting the previous code.

 I.e., go to XXX link and download all the pages, then go to YYY link and do the same, then for each element in XXX go to ZZZ and do the same... if the chains are not very complex.

 If you don't know the links chain or if they are very complex, then switch to b).


 b) If you have to go to Finviz and reproduce almost all the Stock Screener features or something alike, then try again contacting the author or hire a specialized consultant, as I can't further assist you with this task at this place. I hope you understand.


 Regards!

Hi SirJB7,


 This is the last try as I do not want this to be a never ending saga, after going through this code at length it appears that it does gat all the data from Yahoo but sends this data to hidden Excel sheets, and Finviz web page. Also the tickers, stock exchange, Indice appear to be on a hidden xl page, so I guess you cannot change the stock codes. I guess they are on the workbook or setup sheets which are hidden.


 I have has a look at the yahoo site and the method to get the data is:


 (1) Use: http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=


 (2) Enter the stock codes you want the data on, with a "+" beteween each code (eg WWY+STJ)


 (3) type: &f= and the ten yahoo tag codes (maximum input)you require data on (eg &f-nl1rr5dp6m8m6j6s7)


 So the total example url of 1-3 would be: 


 http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=WWY+STJ&f-nl1rr5dp6m8m6j6s7.


 Data would be displayed in excel as follows:


 Name Price P/E PEG Div/share Price/Book Change from 50-day MA Change from 200-day MA Change from 52-week low Short Ratio

 WWY 0 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A

 St. Jude Medical, 41.43 16.5 1.15 0.94 3.07 -0.51% 5.55% 36.96% 3.7.


 So my question is how can you code to loop numerous times (eg 8-9 times), to enter all the yahoo tag codes, for the required stocks, creating a wait time to collate all the data, then input the data into an excel spreadsheet.


 ie could we loop using the following case code:


 Function smfYahooCodeDesc(pCode As String)


 '-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

 ' User defined function to give a description to a Yahoo code (to be used for column headings)

 '-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

 ' 2007.09.09 -- Created function

 '-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#62; Version 2.0h

 ' &#62; Examples of an invocation:

 '

 ' =smfYahooCodeDesc("l1")

 ' =smfYahooCodeDesc(A1)

 '-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

Select Case pCode

 Case "a": smfYahooCodeDesc = "Ask"

 Case "a2": smfYahooCodeDesc = "Average Daily Volume"

 Case "a5": smfYahooCodeDesc = "Ask Size"

 Case "b": smfYahooCodeDesc = "Bid"

 Case "b2": smfYahooCodeDesc = "Ask (ECN)"

 Case "b3": smfYahooCodeDesc = "Bid (ECN)"

 Case "b4": smfYahooCodeDesc = "Book Value"

 Case "b6": smfYahooCodeDesc = "Bid Size"

 Case "c": smfYahooCodeDesc = "Change & Percent"

Hi, ballterrier!


 I was yet beginning to miss you... :)


 Tomorrow I hope having a little of time to see where I land after following your new indications, but I can't assure you that. If not, on Monday (I'm at GMT-3, so now it's Thursday midnight and a few minutes).


 It's just a matter of time, that's why the originators would have been the first choice, but if the didn't answer, well, we should have to go thru this forums, and if we don't succeed, who knows? Let us wait a little more.

Lol SirJB7,


 Not speaking to you for nearly three days is most disappointing :&#62;)


 the setup of the spreadsheet I would like is as follows:


 (1) Ticker name in column A, following by all the stock names underneath as follows:


 AAC

 ABC

 ACR

 AGK

 AIX

 AMC

 AMP

 ANN

 ANZ

 APA

 ARG

 ASB

 ASX

 AWC

 AWE

 AZJ

 BBG

 BEN

 BHP

 BKL

 BKN

 BLD

 BOQ

 BSL

 BWP

 BXB

 CAB

 CBA

 CCL

 CGF

 COH

 CPU

 CSL

 CTX

 DJS

 DMP

 DOW

 DUE

 ERA

 FLT

 FMG

 FXJ

 GFF

 GNS

 HVN

 IIN

 ILU

 IPL

 IRE

 JBH

 JHX

 KAR

 LEI

 LLC

 LNC

 MLB

 MND

 MQG

 MTS

 MYR

 NAB

 NCM

 NWS

 ORG

 ORI

 OSH

 PDN

 PPT

 QAN

 QBE

 RHC

 RIO

 RMD

 SEK

 SGM

 SGP

 SGT

 SHL

 SKI

 SLX

 STO

 SUN

 SWM

 SYD

 TAH

 TEN

 TGR

 TOL

 TRS

 TTS

 UGL

 WBC

 WDC

 WOW

 WPL

 WTF


 (2)Then I would put headers in the next 85 columns (ie following Ticker Name in column A),


 (3) The vba code would then would wrap sevens times to collate all the data for all the above stock codes and the undermentioned Yahoo tags, and extract them in the 85 columns for each stock.


 Note: I have changed the stock codes, as I have noticed that there are some differences in the codes used in the stock screener spreadsheet, and the ones I have found. It's probably because this code was made over 4-5 yras ago.

 Use Paste Special to multiply (or add, divide etc.) a range with a variable [quick tip]

 Use Paste Special to multiply (or add, divide etc.) a range with a variable [quick tip] 
Here is a fun way to use Paste Special to quickly multiply everything in a range with 1.1 (why 1.1? Well, imagine you have a report with everything in US $s and your boss wants to see the numbers in Australian $s…)

Since your report has different formulas for each cell, you can’t multiply first cell with a rate variable and drag it down. You have to manually edit each formula and add *rate at the end of it.

Oh wait…, you can use Paste Special.

 Changing stubborn opinions with visualizations [case study] 
We, analysts take pride in the fact that we tell stories. But what if you have a boss, client or colleague who wouldn’t buy the story?

This is a problem we face often. Let’s say your boss has stubborn opinion about something, like more advertising leads to more sales. You know the data doesn’t support this theory. But how do you change your boss’ mind?
