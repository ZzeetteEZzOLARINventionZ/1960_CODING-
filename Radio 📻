Radiospeak, techspeak, milspeak, NASAspeak, and compuspeak all
developed for spoken, sent, or stored brevity.  As Larry Van Horn
is always noting, acronyms and abbreviations don't always save all
that much space in written text.  Utility World tries to slog
through all the alphabet soup and write in good old English.

Sometimes we fail.  Decode our lapses thusly:
